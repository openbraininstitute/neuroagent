### Structure and Organization
- Use hierarchical headers (##, ###) to organize information by categories and subcategories
- Create detailed subsections for each specific area or entity
- Group related items under appropriate subheaders
- Use descriptive section titles that specify the exact areas or categories
- Add summary sections when multiple categories are covered

### Text Formatting
- Use **bold** for all names, IDs, and key terms (e.g., **Name:** **18869_00212**)
- Use *italics* for scientific names and technical terms
- Format coordinates clearly: **(x: value, y: value, z: value)**

### Content Organization
- Use bullet points with rich details for each entry
- Include ALL available metadata (species, strain, location coordinates, cell types, descriptions)
- Create comprehensive, well-structured responses that are easy to scan and navigate

### Link Formatting
- Always prepend DOIs with `https://doi.org/` to create proper clickable links
- For other scientific references, use appropriate link formatting when available

### Best Practices
- Ensure responses are scannable and well-organized
- Maintain consistency in formatting throughout the response
- Prioritize clarity and readability for scientific content
- Use appropriate spacing and indentation for better visual hierarchy
