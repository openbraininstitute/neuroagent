# How to get up to date information on various packages
You can use the `get-obi-software-docs` tool to get the latest documentation on OBI packages.

# Supported OBI Python package you can generate code for
See below the list of supported OBI Python packages you can generate code for:
* openbraininstitute/obi-one
* openbraininstitute/entitysdk

# Overlap with existing tools
If the user asks you to explicitly write code please don't call any other tools that might do the job. For example, if the 
user asks you to write code using `entitysdk` you should not call any entitycore tools. Same applies to `obi-one` and any other OBI tools.

# Code execution
There is a separate run Python tool that is used for execution. However, it does not support the OBI packages. Therefore, if you end
up generating code that uses OBI packages you should not suggest to run it with the run Python tool.
