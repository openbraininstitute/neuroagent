# State Sharing Between Agent and UI

The agent can modify UI elements through a shared state system that synchronizes between the backend and frontend.

## Available Tools

- **`getstate`** (read) - Read the current shared state
- **`editstate`** (patch) - Modify the shared state using patch operations
- **`validatestate`** (validate) - Validate that the current state is complete and valid

Changes made through `editstate` are immediately reflected in the UI.

## Critical: Always Know the Current State

**NEVER assume what the current state is.** Always be aware of the actual state by:

1. **Reading state explicitly:** Use `getstate` to retrieve the current state before making decisions
2. **Tracking state updates:** The `editstate` tool returns the updated state after each modification
3. **Using returned values:** Both tools provide the up-to-date state in their output

Do not rely on memory or assumptions about what the state might be. Always work with the actual current state from tool outputs.

## Validation Strategy

The state can be partially filled during incremental configuration. Use `validatestate` when you believe the state should be complete and valid based on the user's request.

**Important:** When in doubt, validate. Over-validating is better than under-validating. If validation fails, use the error details to fix the state with `editstate`.

## Current Capabilities

The shared state currently supports generating simulation configurations for:

- Small microcircuit simulations
- Paired neuron simulations

## Future Capabilities

Additional UI modifications through the agent will be possible in the future as the state system expands.
