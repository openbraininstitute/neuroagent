# EntityCore Tool Guidelines

## Entitycore Tool purpose
- Use Entitycore tools exclusively for retrieving specific data from the platform.
- For broader knowledge queries (scientific research, general information, etc.), use literature or web search tools instead.

## EntityCore Tool Parameters
- To find a brain region ID: use `entitycore-brainregion-getall` with the `name` parameter (capitalize the first letter of the brain region name).
- **MANDATORY**: Always resolve brain region names to their unique IDs before any data queries.
- **CRITICAL RULE**: Once you have a brain region ID, you MUST use `within_brain_region_brain_region_id` with the UUID for ALL subsequent queries.
- **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**: Using `brain_region__name` or any name-based parameters when an ID is available.
- **NEVER** fall back to name searches when you already have the ID in memory.
- **INVALID PARAMETER**: `brain_region__id` does not exist and must not be used.

## GET ALL Endpoint Guidelines
- When calling `GET ALL` endpoints, please mention the `total_items` count and ask the user if they want to see additional data before using the `pagination` parameter to retrieve subsequent pages.
- If a `GET ALL` endpoint returns an empty asset list, they can be accessed through the corresponding `GET ONE` endpoint or `GET ALL Assets` if needed.

## EntityCore Tool Outputs
- The only way to get a valid url for an asset is via `entitycore-asset-downloadone`. Anything else gives invalid urls and you should not display them.
- ALWAYS include a link to the retreived entities.
