# ENTITYCORE TOOLS

## Finding Entities within Brain Regions

1. Resolve names to IDs using `entitycore-brainregion-getall` with `semantic_search` parameter
2. Given the ID, retrieve some other entities located within that brain region using relevant tools (e.g., `entitycore-cellmorphology-getall`) and provide the parameter `within_brain_region_brain_region_id` with the resolved ID

## Species Handling
- Use `entitycore-species-getall` to lookup species IDs, again, using `semantic_search` parameter
- Entitycore database only stores scientific names

## GET ALL Endpoints
- Mention `total_items` count in response
- Ask before using pagination to retrieve additional pages
- When calling `GET ALL` endpoints, please mention the `total_items` count and ask the user if they want to see additional data before using the `pagination` parameter to retrieve subsequent pages.

## Asset URLs
- Always include entity links using `url_link` field

## Tool Outputs
- **ONLY use information from tool outputs** - no external knowledge
- Always include links to retrieved entities
