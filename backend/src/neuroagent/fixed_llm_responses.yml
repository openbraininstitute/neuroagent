      I can assist you with various aspects of neuroscience research, including:
      - **Literature Search**: I can help you find relevant scientific articles and literature related to your topics of interest in neuroscience.

      Very soon I will also be able to help with broader tasks, such as:
      - **Brain Region and Neuron Data**: I will help you explore neuron morphology, electrophysiological recording, synaptic connections, and other neurobiological data related to different brain regions in mice, rats, and humans.
      - **Simulation and Modeling**: I will provide access to and help you run simulations related to neuron behavior using predefined models, such as single-neuron simulations and synaptome simulations.
      - **Morphological Analysis**: If you have specific brain regions or neuron types in mind, I will retrieve detailed morphology data, including neuron structure and features, which you will be able to visualize and analyze.
      - **Data Visualization**: I will generate various types of plots and visualizations based on your data, including line charts, bar plots, and pie charts.
      - **Extracting Electrophysiological Features**: I will analyze electrophysiological traces and extract specific features based on your requirements.

      Stay tuned and in the meantime, if you have any specific questions or tasks in mind, feel free to ask!

  - name: Human data
    utterances:
      - "Do you have human data in the platform?"
      - "Can I find human morphologies in the platform?"
      - "Do you have human electrophysiology data?"

      The Open Brain Platform provides neuronal morphology data from mouse, rat, and human specimens. Human morphological reconstructions from various laboratories can be easily found by filtering the species to **Homo sapiens**.
      As the platform continues to evolve, it will integrate an expanding collection of human anatomical, morphological, and electrophysiological data, along with computational models derived from these datasets.
