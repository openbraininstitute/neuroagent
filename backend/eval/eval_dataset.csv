How can I simulate on the platform ?,"Here is a tutorial on how to simulate on the platform, specifically for simulating a single neuron model:

How to Simulate a Single Neuron Model on the Platform
Access Virtual Lab:

From the homepage, click the ""Go to Virtual Lab"" button.
Manage Projects:

Click on ""Projects"" in the left menu to see your projects.
Create a project if none exists.
Ensure you have credits in your project; transfer credits from your virtual lab if needed.
Build a Single Neuron Model:

Click on the ""Build"" column in the left panel.
Click the ""Build"" button in the single neuron tile.
Name your model, optionally add a description.
Select the brain region (e.g., primary somatosensory area).
Click ""Start building.""
Select a 3D reconstructed morphology (M model) and an existing electrical model (E model).
Filter morphologies by type (e.g., L5 TPC-A for thick tufted layer 5 pyramidal neuron).
Select the appropriate E model matching the morphology.
Save the created morph-electric model (M E model).
Simulate the Neuron Model:

Go back to your project homepage.
Click on the ""Simulate"" tab, then ""Single Neuron.""
Find your neuron model or search by name.
Click your model and press ""New Simulation.""
In the simulation window, pan, rotate, and zoom the neuron morphology.
Set experiment and simulation parameters.
Choose predefined current injection protocols or customize current steps.
Add multiple recording locations by clicking on the morphology or using the ""Add Recording"" button.
Press ""Simulate"" to run the simulation.
View and Save Results:

The ""Results"" tab will display recordings from selected locations.
Save recordings or save them to the library for later access.

What are some recent studies on neuron morphology in the cerebrum?,"Here are some recent studies on neuron morphology in the cerebrum:

### 1. {{Key morphological features of human pyramidal neurons}}
- **Published:** {{May 14, 2024}}
- **Summary:** This study performed intracellular injections and 3D reconstructions of over 200 pyramidal neurons from the human occipital primary visual area and associative temporal cortex. It found that pyramidal neurons in the temporal cortex are larger, have more complex dendritic structures, and more spines compared to those in the primary sensory cortex.

### 2. {{What makes human cortical pyramidal neurons functionally complex}}
- **Published:** {{December 17, 2024}}
- **Author:** {{Ido Aizenbud et al.}}
- **Summary:** This preprint explores the functional complexity of human cortical pyramidal neurons, focusing on their morphology and how it relates to their function.
- **DOI:** {{https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.17.628883}}

### 4. {{Neuronal diversity and stereotypy at multiple scales through whole brain morphometry}}
- **Published:** {{November 26, 2024}}
- **Summary:** This article discusses neuronal diversity and stereotypy using whole brain morphometry, providing insights into neuron morphology at multiple scales.
- **Link:** {{[PMC Article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11599929/)}}

### 5. {{A Multi-Scale Neuron Morphometry Dataset from Peta-voxel Mouse Whole-Brain Images}}
- **Published:** {{April 23, 2025}}
- **Author:** {{Hanchuan Peng}}
- **Summary:** This study presents a large-scale neuron morphometry dataset from whole-brain mouse images, offering a cloud-based platform for collaborative neuron morphology analysis.
