      "reason": "The actual output provides a list of species with relevant details such as ID, name, and taxonomy ID, which aligns with the input request for the first 10 available species. However, the structure differs significantly from the expected output, which presents species names followed by taxonomy IDs in a simpler format. Additionally, the actual output mentions a total of 9 species instead of 10, which does not fully meet the input requirement. The summary at the end is a positive addition but does not compensate for the structural discrepancies."
