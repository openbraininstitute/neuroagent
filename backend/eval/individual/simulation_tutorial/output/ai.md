## Overview \u2014 how to run simulations on the Open Brain Platform\n\nBelow I give a concise, step\u2011by\u2011step workflow you can follow to run simulations on the platform, the types of objects you can simulate, and practical tips to get results quickly.\n\n### 1) Decide what you want to simulate\n- Single neuron behavior (electrical/e-models, me-models)\n- Morphology + electrophysiology combined (ME-model simulations)\n- Small circuits / microcircuits / region- or system-level simulations\n- Synaptome / connectivity or bespoke experiments (stimulus protocols, perturbations)\nDeciding the scale determines which platform artifacts and tools you\u2019ll need (e.g., me-model IDs for single-neuron simulations; circuits for circuit-level simulation).\n\n### 2) Locate the required entities (morphologies, e-models, me-models, circuits)\n- Use the platform\u2019s atlas-driven catalog (entitycore) to find:\n  - **Morphologies** and their IDs\n  - **E-models** (electrical models) and their IDs\n  - **ME-models** (morphology + electrical model) \u2014 these are ready-to-run neuron models\n  - **Circuits** (microcircuits, region circuits) if you want to simulate networks\n- Important: always resolve brain region names to their unique brain-region IDs before filtering by brain region.\n\nIf you want, I can search the catalogue for a specific species / brain region / cell type and return candidate me-model or circuit IDs.\n\n### 3) Prepare a simulation configuration\nA simulation config describes:\n- Which entity to simulate (me-model ID or circuit ID)\n- Simulation duration, time step (dt), and solver settings\n- Stimulation protocol(s) (current injections, synaptic inputs, patterned inputs)\n- Recording targets (membrane potential traces, spike times, synaptic variables)\n- Output formats and analysis requests (spike raster, voltage traces, summary metrics)\n\nTip: The platform provides tools to generate JSON configs from natural-language descriptions. Always provide a complete description of the final desired config (not just incremental changes).\n\n### 4) Generate/validate the simulation JSON\n- The platform requires a structured JSON config for the run.\n- Use the platform\u2019s config generator to transform your experiment description into valid JSON. The generator will return a ready-to-run config for the specified circuit or ME-model.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, give me the circuit or me-model ID plus a full description of the experiment and I will generate the simulation config for you.\n\n### 5) Launch the simulation\n- Submit the validated JSON to the simulation runner on the platform.\n- Select compute options if available (local vs cloud, number of cores, runtime limits).\n- For large circuits, consider running a short test (smaller duration or fewer neurons) first.\n\n### 6) Monitor and retrieve outputs\n- Watch the run status (queued \u2192 running \u2192 completed / failed).\n- When completed, download outputs (voltage traces, spike times, summary CSVs, plots).\n- The platform often exposes logs and resource metrics to help debug failed runs.\n\n### 7) Post-processing and analysis\n- Use built-in notebooks to analyze outputs (e.g., spike rasters, PSTHs, firing-rate statistics).\n- Export outputs for external analyses (Python, MATLAB).\n- If you want automatic analysis included in runs, specify that in the config (e.g., compute firing rates, ISI histograms).\n\n### 8) Iterate and refine\n- Tune model parameters, stimulation, or network connectivity and re-run.\n- For parameter sweeps or batch experiments, generate a campaign of configs (varying a parameter across runs).\n\n---\n\n## Typical quick example (single neuron current clamp)\n- Pick an **ME-model** ID\n- Specify: duration = 1000 ms, dt = 0.025 ms\n- Stimulus: current injection at soma, amplitude = 200 pA, start = 100 ms, duration = 500 ms\n- Record: soma Vm, spike times\n- Output: voltage trace (.npy/.csv), spike times (.csv), summary firing rate\n\nIf you give me:\n- whether you want a single neuron or a circuit,\n- species and brain region (or an entity ID if you have one),\n- a short description of the experiment (duration, stimuli, recordings),\n\nI will:\n- locate matching me-models or circuits (if you want), and\n- generate a complete JSON simulation config ready for submission.\n\nWould you like me to (pick one):\n1) Search the catalogue for me-models or circuits for a specific species/region?\n2) Build a simulation config from a textual experiment description you provide?\n3) Walk through launching a simulation you already have an ID for?
