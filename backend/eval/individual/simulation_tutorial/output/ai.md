## Overview \u2014 How to run simulations on the Open Brain Platform\n\nBelow is a concise, step-by-step guide describing the paths you can take to run simulations on the platform, the types of simulations supported, what inputs are required, and practical tips to get started quickly.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Simulation types available\n- **Single-neuron simulations** \u2014 run electrophysiological models (e-models) or morphology + e-model (me-models) on an individual neuron.\n- **Synaptome / small circuits** \u2014 paired neurons, small microcircuits (3\u201320 neurons) with intrinsic/extrinsic connectivity.\n- **Region / system / whole-brain** \u2014 atlas-driven circuits built from neuron densities, connectivity and synaptome (available as those models are released).\n- **Metabolism and NGV notebooks** \u2014 specialized notebooks (notebooks available for download/execution).\n\n---\n\n## 2) Typical workflow (recommended order)\n1. Identify or create the model (me-model, e-model, circuit)\n   - Use existing **me-models** / **e-models** or build a new one by combining morphology + electrical model.\n   - For larger circuits, choose an atlas region or supply a circuit definition.\n2. Configure simulation parameters\n   - Set protocol (current injection, synaptic input patterns, stimulation schedule).\n   - Set runtime (simulation length, time step), recording probes, and output format.\n3. Generate a simulation configuration (JSON)\n   - The platform requires a complete simulation configuration file (circuit id, stimuli, recording probes, solver settings).\n   - Use the platform\u2019s simulation configurator or request the assistant to build the JSON for you.\n4. Run the simulation\n   - Launch via the web UI or through the simulation API/runner using the configuration file.\n5. Monitor and retrieve results\n   - Monitor job status (started / running / done / failure).\n   - Download traces, spike times, model state snapshots, or analysis notebooks.\n6. Postprocess & analyze\n   - Use built-in notebooks or export data for external analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Required inputs and key options\n- **Model/Circuit ID** \u2014 UUID of the me-model, e-model, or circuit you want to simulate.\n- **Simulation config** \u2014 JSON describing:\n  - circuit_id (required)\n  - stimuli (type, amplitude/timecourse, target compartments or cell IDs)\n  - simulation length, dt (time step)\n  - recording probes (variables, locations, sample rate)\n  - seed / randomness control\n  - output formats and destinations\n- **Resources / runtime** \u2014 select compute resources if applicable (CPU/GPU, cluster queue).\n- **Authorization / project** \u2014 ensure the simulation is authorized for the target project or public.\n\n---\n\n## 4) How I can help (actions I can take immediately)\n- Build a complete simulation configuration JSON from your natural-language description. (I will call the platform config generator tool; I need a circuit ID.)\n- If you don\u2019t yet have a circuit or model ID, I can:\n  - Search for suitable me-models / e-models / circuits (if you provide the brain region or species).\n  - Recommend a starter configuration (single neuron current-clamp protocol, default dt and recording settings).\n- Provide step-by-step instructions to launch the job via the UI or via the API and interpret outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Example quick-start (single-neuron current clamp)\n- Model: choose a **me-model** (morphology + e-model)\n- Stimulus: square current injection, start = 100 ms, duration = 500 ms, amplitude = 0.2 nA\n- Simulation duration: 800 ms; dt = 0.025 ms\n- Record: soma membrane potential (Vm) at 10 kHz\n- Output: voltage trace (CSV) + spike times\n\nIf you want, I will generate the complete simulation JSON for that example \u2014 I just need the target circuit/me-model UUID (or I can search for a suitable me-model for your brain region/species).\n\n---\n\n## 6) Practical tips and best practices\n- Use me-models validated on the same brain region and species as your experiment.\n- Keep dt small enough to capture spikes (0.025\u20130.1 ms typical for single-neuron models).\n- Start with short runs for debugging before scaling up long or large-circuit runs.\n- Fix random seeds for reproducibility when stochastic elements are present.\n- Monitor memory/cpu usage for large morphologies or dense connectivity.\n\n---\n\nSummary\n- The platform supports single-neuron to whole-brain scale simulations. You need a circuit/me-model ID and a full JSON config to run a job. I can generate that JSON for you, or search for models/circuits. Tell me which option you want:\n  - A) Generate a simulation config for the example current-clamp (I\u2019ll need the circuit/me-model UUID or I can search for one), or\n  - B) Search for available me-models / circuits for a given species and brain region, or\n  - C) Show exact UI/API steps to submit a configuration you already have.\n\nWhich would you like me to do now?
