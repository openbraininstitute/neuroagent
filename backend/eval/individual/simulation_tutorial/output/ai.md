## Overview \u2014 How to simulate on the Open Brain Platform\n\nBelow is a concise, step\u2011by\u2011step guide to run simulations on the Open Brain Platform, organized by task (preparation, selecting assets/models, configuring runs, execution, and results). Follow the steps that match the scale and type of simulation you want (single neuron, me-model, synaptome, microcircuit, region, system, or whole\u2011brain).\n\n---\n\n### 1) Decide simulation scale & scope\n- **Single neuron / me-model**: explore electrophysiology, ion channel dynamics or single\u2011cell responses.  \n- **Synaptome / small microcircuit**: study connectivity motifs and synaptic interactions.  \n- **Region / system / whole_brain**: atlas\u2011driven large circuits with cell densities and connectivity.  \n\nPick the scale first \u2014 it determines which assets and notebooks you\u2019ll use.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Prepare and inspect required assets\n- Identify required assets: **morphologies**, **e-models** (electrical models), **me-models** (morphology+electrical type), **ion channels**, **synaptomes**, **circuits**, and **datasets**.\n- Use the platform browser (or EntityCore endpoints via the assistant) to find assets for the species/brain region of interest.\n- For species requests: the platform uses *scientific names* (e.g., *Mus musculus*). If you want me to fetch assets by species/region I can run the EntityCore lookup for you.\n\nKey checks:\n- Model compatibility (morphology \u2194 emodel / me-model).\n- Brain region ID resolution (always resolve names to IDs before queries if using EntityCore \u2014 the platform enforces this).\n- Licensing and authorization (public vs project\u2011restricted assets).\n\n---\n\n### 3) Choose a simulation notebook or tool\n- The platform provides notebook templates for common simulations:\n  - Single neuron / me-model validation\n  - Synaptome / network simulation\n  - Metabolism and NGV units\n- Pick the notebook that matches your experiment. Notebooks are executable; you can download and run them locally or (soon) run them directly on the platform.\n\nIf you want, tell me the scale and target brain region and I will suggest the exact notebook(s) available.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Configure simulation parameters\n- Required configuration elements:\n  - Circuit ID (for circuit-based runs) \u2014 always include when creating a config.\n  - Simulation duration, timestep, and solver settings.\n  - Stimulation protocol (current injection, synaptic drive, extrinsic inputs).\n  - Recording outputs (voltage traces, spike times, synaptic currents, spatial sampling).\n  - Random seeds, population sizes, cell type composition (for microcircuits/regions).\n- Use the platform GUI or the Simulation Config generator (the assistant can create structured JSON configs for you). The platform requires a complete description of the final configuration (not incremental edits) when generating configs.\n\nIf you want, provide the circuit ID (or tell me which circuit) and the desired settings and I will generate a full simulation config JSON for you.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Validation & preflight checks\n- Validate model compatibility (me-model validation status).  \n- Check that all referenced assets exist and are authorized for your project.  \n- Run short test simulations (smaller duration or fewer cells) to confirm stability and outputs.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Submit and execute the simulation\n- For small/single\u2011neuron runs you can typically run locally from the notebook or via the platform\u2019s execution service.\n- For larger circuits, use the platform\u2019s job submission to run on the compute backend. Provide:\n  - Simulation config (JSON)\n  - Circuit ID\n  - Resource requirements (CPUs/GPUs, memory, wall time)\n- Track progression via simulation-execution entries (status: created \u2192 running \u2192 done/error).\n\nI can help create the submission payload and track executions if you give me the circuit ID or simulation config details.\n\n---\n\n### 7) Retrieve and analyze results\n- Retrieve outputs (voltage traces, spike rasters, connectivity stats) from the simulation execution record.\n- Use platform notebooks for analysis and visualization (e.g., spike raster, PSTH, synthetic imaging).\n- Export data for offline analysis (CSV, HDF5, NWB where supported).\n\n---\n\n### 8) Common workflows / examples\n- Validate an me-model: pick morphology + emodel \u2192 create me-model \u2192 run single neuron validation simulation \u2192 compare traces to electrophysiological targets.\n- Small microcircuit: select cell types and densities \u2192 assemble circuit (intrinsic+extrinsic connectivity) \u2192 configure stimulation & run \u2192 analyze emergent network dynamics.\n- Region simulation: select species & region (must use region UUID) \u2192 set population composition and connection rules \u2192 run atlas-based simulation \u2192 compute region\u2011level measures.\n\nIf you tell me which of these workflows you want to run (scale, species, brain region, or an existing circuit ID), I will:\n- Resolve any required brain region UUIDs,\n- List candidate assets and their metadata,\n- Generate a complete simulation JSON config (using the platform\u2019s simulation config generator tool),\n- And optionally prepare the job submission payload.\n\n---\n\n## Quick checklist to get started (copyable)\n- [ ] Choose scale (single / pair / small / microcircuit / region / system / whole_brain)  \n- [ ] Identify circuit ID or assets (morphology, emodel/me-model, synaptome)  \n- [ ] Define simulation duration, dt, stim protocol, outputs  \n- [ ] Generate full simulation config JSON  \n- [ ] Run preflight short test run  \n- [ ] Submit full run and monitor execution  \n- [ ] Download and analyze results\n\n---\n\nIf you want to proceed now, tell me:\n- The simulation scale (e.g., single neuron, microcircuit, region),\n- Species (common name is fine; I will map to scientific name),\n- Target brain region (I will resolve the UUID),\n- Or an existing circuit ID if you have one.\n\nI will then autonomously generate the complete simulation config and list the assets and steps needed to run the job.
