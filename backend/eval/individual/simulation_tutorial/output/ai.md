## Overview \u2014 How to run simulations on the Open Brain Platform\n\nBelow I give a concise, actionable guide to run simulations on the platform, the common simulation types, required steps, typical parameters, and pointers to useful tools and resources available on the platform.\n\n### 1) Choose the simulation scale and type\n- **Single neuron simulation** \u2014 simulate one neuron (e.g., current injections, IV curves). Good for testing e-models / me-models.\n- **Pair / small microcircuit** \u2014 simulate interactions between 2 to ~20 neurons (synaptic connectivity, short circuits).\n- **Microcircuit / region / system / whole-brain** \u2014 larger, atlas\u2011driven circuits. Use these when you want anatomically constrained connectivity and population dynamics.\n- **Notebook-based models** \u2014 metabolism and NGV, single neuron/synaptome notebooks available for download and remote execution.\n\n### 2) Locate or create the circuit / model\n- Use the platform\u2019s atlas and entity browser to find an existing **circuit**, **me-model**, **e-model**, **morphology**, or **simulation** you want to run or base your work on.\n- For species, always prefer the scientific name (e.g., *Mus musculus*) when searching.\n\n### 3) Resolve brain region IDs (required for region-based simulations)\n- All atlas-driven queries must use brain region IDs (UUIDs) rather than names.\n- Use the platform brain-region lookup (entitycore) to get the brain region UUID before any region-scoped queries. This UUID must be used for subsequent region-scoped API calls.\n\n### 4) Prepare the simulation configuration\n- Decide:\n  - circuit_id (UUID of the circuit you will simulate)\n  - simulation duration, time-step, random seeds\n  - stimulation protocol (current steps, synaptic input patterns, Poisson drives)\n  - recording targets (which cells, which variables: Vm, spikes, synaptic currents)\n  - whether to use plasticity, neuromodulation, or metabolic constraints\n  - compute resources / parallelism (if configurable)\n- If you want a structured JSON configuration, the platform provides a tool that generates valid simulation JSON from a natural language description (the simulation config generator). Always provide a complete final description of the desired configuration (not just incremental edits).\n\n### 5) Use the simulation config generator (recommended)\n- The platform enforces using the simulation-config generation tool for producing the JSON configuration required by the simulator. Provide:\n  - the target **circuit_id** (UUID)\n  - a complete description of everything that should be in the final configuration\n- The tool returns the final simulation JSON you can submit.\n\n### 6) Submit the simulation\n- For single-neuron simulations there are dedicated endpoints (single-neuron-simulation create / get). For larger circuits, use the simulation submission workflow associated with the circuit.\n- Typical steps:\n  - upload/select assets (me-models, e-models, morphologies) if not already in circuit\n  - attach the generated simulation config JSON\n  - select runtime options and resource allocation\n  - submit/run\n\n### 7) Monitor progress and retrieve results\n- The platform provides status fields (started, running, success, failure). Poll the simulation GET endpoints to monitor status.\n- For single-neuron simulations use the single-neuron-simulation endpoints to fetch detailed results and downloadable artifacts.\n- All simulation outputs and assets (plots, traces, spike times, logs) are accessible through the platform UI and via asset download APIs.\n\n### 8) Analyze results\n- Download traces and spike data for offline analysis or use built-in notebooks and analysis tools on the platform.\n- For numerical operations or derived statistics, you can run the platform notebooks or use the platform\u2019s Python execution tools.\n\n### 9) Reproducibility and sharing\n- Record:\n  - circuit_id, simulation_id, random seed(s), versioned asset IDs (me-model, e-model, morphology)\n  - full JSON simulation config\n- Share via platform project permissions or publish the simulation as an asset.\n\n## Practical tips and best practices\n- Always include explicit UUIDs (circuit_id, brain region id, asset ids) in configs \u2014 avoid name-based queries when an ID exists.\n- Start small (single neuron or pair) to validate stimulation protocols before scaling up.\n- Use deterministic seeds for reproducibility.\n- If you need a simulation config generated from a natural language description, provide a complete specification including circuit_id \u2014 I will generate the config using the platform generator tool.\n\n## If you want, I can:\n- Generate a full simulation JSON for you if you provide:\n  - target circuit_id (UUID) or tell me which circuit to use (I can help find the circuit id)\n  - exact simulation requirements (duration, stimuli, recording targets, plasticity, number of trials, seeds)\n- Or walk you step-by-step through a specific example (single neuron current step / small microcircuit Poisson drive / region simulation).\n\nWhich would you like me to do next?
