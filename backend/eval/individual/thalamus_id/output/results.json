      "success": true,
      "threshold": 0.5,
      "reason": "The actual output provides a detailed description of the sine function sampled at 8 evenly spaced points, which aligns with the input request. However, it lacks the visual representation of the plot that is implied in the expected output. While it includes the sample points and their coordinates, it does not maintain the same logical flow as the expected output, which emphasizes the plot itself and offers an option for a line plot. The additional offer for CSV or downloadable formats, while informative, diverges from the simplicity of the expected response."
