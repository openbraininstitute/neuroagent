I attempted to run Python to compute the 8 evenly spaced points, but the execution environment failed to import required components. I'll compute the 8 points analytically here and then produce the plot using the plotting tool.\n\n8 evenly spaced x values from 0 to 2\u03c0 are:\n- x_k = k*(2\u03c0/7) for k = 0..7  (note: dividing by 7 gives 8 points including both endpoints)\n\nCompute values (rounded to 6 decimal places):\n\n- **(x: 0.000000, y: 0.000000)**\n- **(x: 0.897598, y: 0.782172)**  [k=1, x = 2\u03c0/7]\n- **(x: 1.795195, y: 0.974928)**  [k=2, x = 4\u03c0/7]\n- **(x: 2.692793, y: 0.433884)**  [k=3, x = 6\u03c0/7]\n- **(x: 3.590391, y: -0.433884)** [k=4, x = 8\u03c0/7]\n- **(x: 4.487988, y: -0.974928)** [k=5, x = 10\u03c0/7]\n- **(x: 5.385586, y: -0.782172)** [k=6, x = 12\u03c0/7]\n- **(x: 6.283185, y: -0.000000)** [k=7, x = 14\u03c0/7 = 2\u03c0]\n\nNow I'll generate the requested plot with those 8 points.
