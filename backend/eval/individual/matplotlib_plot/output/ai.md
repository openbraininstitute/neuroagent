I attempted to run Python to compute points (required by the platform rules for plotting) but the execution environment couldn't import a dependency and failed. I can proceed in two ways \u2014 pick one and I'll act immediately:\n\nOptions:\n1) Retry the computation here (I will run Python again to produce 30 evenly spaced (x,y) points across -5..5 and then generate the plot using the plot generator).\n2) Skip the Python execution and instead I can provide ready-to-run Python/Matplotlib code you can copy and run locally to produce a high-quality plot.\n\nRecommendation: choose option 1 so I produce the actual plot for you here. If you prefer option 2, say so and I'll provide the code.
