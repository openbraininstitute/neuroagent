## Summary \u2014 recent studies on neuron morphology in the cerebrum\nBelow are recent, high-impact studies and reviews (2020\u20132025) that focus on neuronal morphology in the cerebrum (cortex / neocortex / visual cortex / whole-brain cortical neurons). For each entry I give the citation, a 1\u20132 sentence summary, and a link to the article.\n\n### Major datasets and large-scale reconstructions\n- **A Multi-Scale Neuron Morphometry Dataset from Peta-voxel Mouse Whole-Brain Images** (Peng H., 2025)  \n  - Summary: Large cloud-based pipeline and the largest multi-scale morphometry dataset to date from hundreds of sparsely labeled mouse brains: tens of thousands of annotated somata and thousands of traced or fully reconstructed morphologies (axons/dendrites and putative boutons). Valuable for large-scale cortical/cerebral morphology analysis and model building.  \n  - Link: [Nature Scientific Data \u2014 A Multi-Scale Neuron Morphometry Dataset (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04379-0)\n\n- **An unsupervised map of excitatory neuron dendritic morphology in the mouse visual cortex** (Ecker A. S. et al., 2025)  \n  - Summary: Unsupervised, graph-based ML analysis of >30,000 reconstructed excitatory neurons from MICrONS data; proposes a largely continuous morphological landscape across layers with layer-specific exceptions (notably L5/L6). Useful for thinking about morpho-continuum vs discrete m-types in cerebral cortex.  \n  - Link: [Nature Communications \u2014 An unsupervised map (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58763-w)\n\n### Human cortical neuronal morphology\n- **Whole human-brain mapping of single cortical neurons for profiling morphological diversity and stereotypy** (Peng H. et al., Sci Adv, 2023)  \n  - Summary: Adaptive cell tomography applied to surgical and postmortem human cortical tissue; ~1,746 reconstructed cortical neurons from 18 patients \u2014 enables comparison of morphological diversity and stereotypy across human cortex.  \n  - Link: [Science Advances \u2014 Whole human-brain mapping of single cortical neurons (2023)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf3771)\n\n- **Of mice and men: Dendritic architecture differentiates human from mice neuronal networks** (Kanari L. et al., preprint bioRxiv, 2023 \u2192 updated 2024/2025)  \n  - Summary: Comparative study showing systematic differences in dendritic architecture between human and mouse cortical neurons and analyzing consequences for network structure and function. Useful for cross-species comparisons of cerebral neuron morphology.  \n  - Link: [bioRxiv preprint \u2014 Of mice and men (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.11.557170v3.full)\n\n### Reviews and comparative perspectives\n- **Variation and convergence in the morpho-functional properties of the mammalian neocortex** (Mahon S., Front. Syst. Neurosci., 2024)  \n  - Summary: Review comparing structural and electrical properties of neocortical neurons across mammals; discusses dendritic tree length, spine density, and implications for cortical computation \u2014 places human cerebral morphology in a comparative context.  \n  - Link: [Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience \u2014 Variation and convergence (2024)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1413780/full)\n\n- **Database of literature-derived cellular measurements** (Leergaard T. B. et al., Nature Sci Data, 2020)  \n  - Summary: Curated database of cellular measurements from the literature \u2014 useful resource for comparing morphology-related metrics (dendritic lengths, spine densities) across cerebral regions and species.  \n  - Link: [Nature Scientific Data \u2014 Database of literature derived cellular measurements (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0550-3)\n\n## How I selected these\n- Focused on 2020\u20132025 primary datasets, comparative analyses, and reviews specifically addressing cortical/cerebral neuron morphology, reconstructions, and large-scale mapping.\n\n## Would you like any of the following next?\n- A PDF summary file (one-page synthesis) comparing key metrics reported in these papers (I can extract main numeric results).  \n- A focused list of morphological datasets and where to download SWC files for cortex neurons (mouse or human).  \n- A short reading order (recommended sequence) depending on whether you want dataset methods, comparative biology, or computational analyses.
