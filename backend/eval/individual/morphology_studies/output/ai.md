## Summary \u2014 recent notable studies on neuron morphology in the cerebrum\nBelow I list several recent, high-impact or comprehensive studies (2023\u20132024) that focus on neuronal morphology in cerebral cortex / cerebrum (human or rodent). For each entry I give the citation, short summary of the main morphological contribution, species/region, and a direct link to the paper.\n\n### 1) Whole human-brain mapping of single cortical neurons for profiling morphological diversity and stereotypy\n- **Citation:** Peng H. et al., Science Advances (2023)\n- **Key points:** Introduces \u201cACTomography\u201d, a high-throughput approach for single-cell labeling and whole\u2011brain imaging in human tissue to quantify morphological diversity and stereotypy of cortical neurons at large scale.\n- **Species / region:** Human \u2014 cortex (whole brain scale)\n- **Why relevant:** Provides large-scale human data and methods for systematic morphological profiling across cortical areas.\n- [Read the paper (Science Advances)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf3771)\n\n### 2) Key morphological features of human pyramidal neurons (preprint)\n- **Citation:** Benavides\u2011Piccione R. et al., bioRxiv (preprint, 2023 \u2192 2024 version)\n- **Key points:** Large dataset and analysis describing main morphological parameters of human pyramidal neurons, with emphasis on dendritic geometry and spine measures.\n- **Species / region:** Human \u2014 neocortical pyramidal cells (supragranular / other layers as sampled)\n- **Why relevant:** Focused morphological quantification of human pyramidal neurons useful for cross-species comparisons and modeling.\n- [Read the preprint (bioRxiv)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.10.566540v2.full)\n\n### 3) Spatial single-cell analysis decodes cortical layer and area organization (open access)\n- **Citation:** (Multiple authors) Nature Communications / PMC (2024)\n- **Key points:** Combines spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) with cell segmentation and imaging to relate molecular identity and spatial organization with structural features across cortical layers and areas.\n- **Species / region:** Human cerebral cortex\n- **Why relevant:** Links morphology/position to molecular cell types and cortical area organization \u2014 helpful when interpreting morphological differences across layers/areas.\n- [Read the paper (PMC full text)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11195106/)\n\n### 4) Electrophysiology and Morphology of Human Cortical Supragranular Pyramidal Cells in a Wide Age Range (reviewed preprint)\n- **Citation:** Aller M.I., Wisden W., et al., eLife reviewed preprint (2024)\n- **Key points:** Presents anatomical reconstructions and electrophysiology of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons across ages; examines age-related morphological and spine changes.\n- **Species / region:** Human \u2014 supragranular neocortical pyramidal neurons\n- **Why relevant:** Provides developmental/aging perspective on morphology combined with electrophysiology.\n- [Read the reviewed preprint (eLife)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.100390.1.sa3)\n\n### 5) (Large EM dataset) Unsupervised map of excitatory neuron dendritic morphology in mouse visual cortex \u2014 (emerging / noteworthy)\n- **Citation:** Ecker A.S. et al., Nature Communications (2025) \u2014 included here as an upcoming/adjacent example from large-scale EM reconstructions of neocortex\n- **Key points:** Uses machine learning to produce a continuous, data-driven morphological \u201cbarcode\u201d for tens of thousands of excitatory neurons reconstructed from large EM volumes (MICrONS).\n- **Species / region:** Mouse \u2014 visual cortex (V1, AL, RL)\n- **Why relevant:** Demonstrates modern computational approaches for large\u2011scale morphological classification and continuous latent morphology representations.\n- [Article (Nature Communications)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58763-w) \u2014 note: this is a 2025 article but conceptually relevant for large-scale morphology studies\n\n## Short interpretation / takeaways\n- There is active work both in human and rodent cortex combining high-throughput imaging or EM reconstructions with computational analysis to quantify morphological diversity at scale.\n- Recent human-focused work emphasizes generating comparable, quantitative datasets (dendritic geometry, spine counts/density) and linking morphology to age, layer, or molecular identity.\n- Large-scale EM / connectomics datasets (e.g., MICrONS) and machine\u2011learning approaches are producing fine-grained morphological maps for many thousands of neurons in mouse cortex \u2014 enabling continuous, data-driven morphology representations rather than discrete m\u2011types.\n\n## Would you like any of the following next steps?\n- I can pull full abstracts and key figures/text excerpts for any of the above papers.\n- I can expand the list to include more rodent EM-based reconstructions (MICrONS, HBP datasets), or older landmark morphology datasets.\n- I can create a table comparing species, region, cell types, methods (Golgi, patch + fill, EM, MERFISH + imaging), and available downloadable morphologies.\n\nWhich next step do you want me to do?
