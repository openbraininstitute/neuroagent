However, it deviates significantly from the expected output structure, which emphasizes a more simplified format with placeholders for descriptions, types, contributors, and licenses. Additionally, the actual output includes morphologies beyond the cerebellum, such as those from the fastigial nucleus and flocculus, which are not relevant to the input request."
