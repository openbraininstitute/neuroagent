    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

Use SQL-like ILIKE semantics when searching text fields.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\n# Find morphologies with a specific mtype pref label\\niterator = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\L5_TPC:A\\\"},\\n    limit=50\\n)\\n\\nfor morph in iterator:\\n    print(f\\ID: {morph.id} | Name: {morph.name} | MType: {morph.mtype}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nOr case-insensitive wildcard search (name__ilike):\\n\\n```python\\nmorphs_named = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    query={\\name__ilike\\\": \\\"%pyramidal%\\\"},\\n    limit=20\\n).all()  # .all() collects the page iterator into a list (if supported by your client)\\n```\\n\\n### 4) Inspect metadata / counts (if returned by the SDK)\\nSome SDK iterator results or helper methods include metadata such as total_items. Check your client iterator object for attributes like `.meta` or API response fields. If not present, count as you iterate (see example 2).\\n\\n### Notes / best practices\\n- Use limit=None to let the SDK automatically page through all results (examples in the docs show this pattern).\\n- Use `query` with API field names (e.g., `\\mtype__pref_label\\`, `\\name__ilike\\`, `\\subject__species__name\\`) to filter results server-side.\\n- If you expect very large result sets, process items incrementally (iterate) instead of collecting into a single list in memory.\\n- The examples assume you already have an authenticated `client` object as used in the SDK examples. Constructing the client depends on your local auth setup (environment variables or explicit credentials).\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Show an example that creates a client from environment variables (if you tell me your auth method), or\\n- Provide a ready-to-run script that saves results to CSV / JSON.",

Simulation costs: **E-model / Ion channel / Single cell / Synaptome = 1 credit / simulation**; **Small microcircuit (\\u226410 neurons) = 10 credits / simulation**; **Microcircuit (>10 neurons) = 0.05 credits / neuron / second of biological time**. |\\n| **Pro** | Paid subscription (Monthly CHF 25 / Yearly CHF 275).

Concludes that excitatory cortical morphology is better described as a continuum (with some layer-specific exceptions) rather than discrete m\\u2011types \\u2014 important for morphological classification and large-scale modeling.  \\n- **Link:** [An unsupervised map of excitatory neuron dendritic morphology (Nature Communications, 2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58763-w)  \\n- ![Morphology map figure from visual cortex study](https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-58763-w/MediaObjects/41467_2025_58763_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n\\n### 3) Related/resource-type papers you may find useful\\n- Morphological diversity and whole\\u2011brain morphometry studies (2021\\u20132024) and other MICrONS-based single-neuron connectivity/morphology integration papers are often cited alongside the above two; these offer additional datasets and methods for large-scale morphological analysis.

With those section lengths returned, the next step will be to create a distribution plot (histogram + KDE) using Plotly.I'll compute summary statistics (mean, median, count) from the returned section lengths and then create a Plotly figure showing a histogram with an overlaid kernel density estimate so you can see the distribution shape. Now I'll run the plotting code.## Plan / next step\\nThe environment returned the section lengths successfully, so the next step is to compute summary statistics and render a distribution plot (histogram + KDE). I attempted to run the plot in the execution environment, but a runtime installation error prevented the plot from being generated. I can either retry plotting here or provide a ready-to-run Plotly script you can execute locally (or run here again if you want me to try a retry).\\n\\n## What I retrieved\\nFrom the morphology ID

resolution). Because of that, I could not produce an embedded figure in this message.\\n\\n## Options \\u2014 pick one\\n1) Retry plotting here now (I will attempt again in the execution environment).  \\n   - If you want me to try again, say \\Retry plot\\\". I will re-run the plotting step and report success or failure.\\n\\n2) I provide a ready-to-run Python + Plotly script that you can execute locally (or paste into a notebook) to reproduce the histogram + KDE with vertical lines for mean and median. This requires no environment work here.\\n\\n3) I compute and return summary statistics (count, mean, median, std, quartiles) here and skip the plot.\\n\\nTell me which you prefer. If you choose option 1, I will attempt to run the plotting tool again. If you choose option 2, the script below is ready.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Ready-to-run Plotly script (copy / paste into a Python environment)\\nThis script uses numpy and plotly.

It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.

Replace the placeholder IDs (circuit_id and neuron id) with actual values from your project.\\n\\nRationale for the next step: to set up a single-cell run we first define the neuron set, timestamps, stimulus and recording blocks and then provide an initialization block that ties the config to a circuit (by ID) and the simulation length; validation ensures the config matches obi-one's schema.\\n\\n```python\\n# Single-cell simulation with obi-one\\n# Replace the placeholders: circuit_id and neuron_id with actual IDs from your project\\n\\nimport obi_one as obi\\n\\n# --- Simulation parameters ---\\nsim_duration = 500.0  # ms\\ncircuit_id = \\13a54362-0c99-43fd-94e4-58bdb5b79466\\   # <-- replace with your circuit UUID\\nneuron_id = 42                                        # <-- replace with your single neuron index/ID\\n\\n# --- 1) Create an empty CircuitSimulationScanConfig ---\\nconfig = obi.CircuitSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\\n\\n# --- 2) Metadata (optional) ---\\ninfo = obi.Info(\\n    campaign_name=\\Single-cell test\\\",\\n    campaign_description=\\Single neuron current clamp test\\\"\\n)\\nconfig.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\\n\\n# --- 3) Neuron set: single neuron by ID ---\\n# Use IDNeuronSet with a single element so the simulation targets one cell\\nsingle_neuron_set = obi.IDNeuronSet(\\n    neuron_ids=obi.NamedTuple(elements=(neuron_id,), name=\\single_neuron\\\")\\n)\\nconfig.add(single_neuron_set, name=\\SingleNeuronSet\\\")\\n\\n# --- 4) Timestamps ---\\n# A single stimulus time at 50 ms (RegularTimestamps with 1 repetition)\\ntimestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=50.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=1.0)\\nconfig.add(timestamps, name=\\Timestamps\\\")\\n\\n# --- 5) Stimulus: somatic current-clamp pulse ---\\ncurrent_stim = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\\n    timestamps=timestamps.ref,  # reference to timestamps block\\n    duration=5.0,               # ms\\n    delay=0.0,                  # relative to timestamp\\n    neuron_set=single_neuron_set.ref,\\n    amplitude=0.3               # nA (adjust as needed)\\n)\\nconfig.add(current_stim, name=\\SomaticPulse\\\")\\n\\n# --- 6) Recording: soma voltage for the single neuron ---\\nsoma_rec = obi.SomaVoltageRecording(\\n    neuron_set=single_neuron_set.ref,\\n    start_time=0.0,\\n    end_time=sim_duration\\n)\\nconfig.add(soma_rec, name=\\SomaVoltage\\\")\\n\\n# --- 7) Initialization: link to circuit and set simulation length ---\\ninitialize = obi.CircuitSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\\n    circuit=obi.CircuitFromID(id_str=circuit_id),\\n    node_set=single_neuron_set.ref,\\n    simulation_length=sim_duration,\\n    v_init=-70.0,         # mV, initial membrane potential\\n    random_seed=1\\n)\\nconfig.set(initialize, name=\\initialize\\\")\\n\\n# --- 8) Validate final configuration ---\\nvalidated_config = config.validated_config()\\n\\n# Print or inspect the validated configuration\\nprint(\\Validated simulation configuration:\\\")\\nprint(validated_config)\\n```\\n\\nNext step: after the configuration is validated, the typical workflow is to submit this config to the platform's simulation service or run it via the obi-one service/CLI used in your environment \\u2014 let me know if you want an example of how to submit/run the validated config (and provide whether you use the local obi-one runner, a remote service, or EntityCore-managed execution).",
