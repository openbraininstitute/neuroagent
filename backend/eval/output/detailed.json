This will let me pick the correct edge population identifier and valid mtype values for grouping.Now that the circuit's node and edge populations are known, the next step is to compute connectivity metrics for the chemical edge population within the circuit, filtering pre-synaptic neurons to the **Inhibitory** nodeset and post-synaptic neurons to the **Excitatory** nodeset, and grouping results by **mtype**. I'll run the connectivity analysis with those selections.## Summary of approach and next step\\n\\nGiven the circuit structure and available node/edge populations, I filtered for chemical connections within the S1 microcircuit using pre-synaptic neurons from the **Inhibitory** nodeset and post-synaptic neurons from the **Excitatory** nodeset, and grouped the results by **mtype** to show inhibitory \\u2192 excitatory connectivity patterns.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Query details (inputs used)\\n- **Circuit ID:** **2eb602ea-9ffc-42a2-9fb7-5234921343d0**  \\n- **Edge population analyzed:** **S1nonbarrel_neurons__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical**  \\n- **Pre node set:** **Inhibitory**  \\n- **Post node set:** **Excitatory**  \\n- **Group by:** **mtype**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Results \\u2014 Inhibitory \\u2192 Excitatory connections (grouped by mtype)\\n\\n| **Pre mtype (Inhibitory)** | **Post mtype (Excitatory)** | **Connection probability (%)** | **Mean number of synapses per connection** |\\n|---|---:|---:|---:|\\n| **L23_CHC** | **L2_TPC:B** | 100.0 | 7.333333333333333 |\\n| **L23_LBC** | **L2_TPC:B** | 0.0 | 0.0 |\\n| **L23_NBC** | **L2_TPC:B** | 16.666666666666668 | 33.0 |\\n| **L23_CHC** | **L3_TPC:A** | 100.0 | 5.0 |\\n| **L23_LBC** | **L3_TPC:A** | 100.0 | 33.0 |\\n| **L23_NBC** | **L3_TPC:A** | 100.0 | 36.0 |\\n\\nNotes:\\n- The table rows reflect each grouped pre/post mtype pair returned by the analysis tool.\\n- Connection probability is reported as a percentage (0\\u2013100).\\n- Mean number of synapses is the average synapse count per realized connection between the grouped pre/post mtype populations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Brief interpretation\\n- Some inhibitory mtypes (e.g., **L23_CHC**) show high (100%) connection probability onto both **L2_TPC:B** and **L3_TPC:A** excitatory mtypes, but with different mean synapse counts (higher for L3 targets? here L3 mean is 5.0 vs L2 mean 7.33 \\u2014 see table).\\n- **L23_LBC \\u2192 L2_TPC:B** shows zero probability (no detected connections), while **L23_LBC \\u2192 L3_TPC:A** shows 100% probability with a large mean synapse count (33.0), indicating very selective targeting.\\n- **L23_NBC** shows mixed targeting: some connectivity to **L2_TPC:B** (16.7% probability, high mean synapses 33.0) and robust connectivity to **L3_TPC:A** (100%, mean 36.0).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggested next steps\\n- If you want, I can:\\n  - Expand grouping to include additional properties (e.g., layer or synapse_class) to see whether the patterns depend on those features.\\n  - Run the same analysis on other chemical edge populations (e.g., thalamic inputs) or include virtual populations (POm, VPM, external) to examine feedforward inhibition.\\n  - Compute summary statistics across all excitatory mtypes (e.g., average connection probability from each inhibitory mtype across all excitatory targets).\\n\\nWhich of these (or another analysis) would you like to run next?",

    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

    "ai_response": "I will fetch the latest entitysdk documentation so I can provide an accurate Python example that uses the current API for listing cell morphologies. With that reference, I can show the exact import, client setup, query parameters, and paging handling.## How to list all cell morphologies in Python with **entitysdk**\\n\\nBelow is a concise, practical example using the current **entitysdk** patterns (from the official examples). It shows:\\n- creating the client,\\n- searching/listing CellMorphology entities,\\n- handling pagination (page/page_size) and an unlimited iterator (limit=None),\\n- filtering by brain region or mtype,\\n- printing key fields (**id**, **name**, brain region label).\\n\\nBefore showing the code, I will explain the next step: use the SDK's `search_entity` method with `entity_type=models.CellMorphology` and either a paged query (using `\\page\\\"` and `\\page_size\\`) or an unlimited iterator (`limit=None`) to retrieve all results.\\n\\n### Example: simple listing (limited results)\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import client as entity_client\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\n# Create the client (auth done via environment or your usual auth method)\\nclient = entity_client.EntityClient()\\n\\n# Get a small sample of morphologies (limit=10)\\niterator = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    limit=10\\n)\\n\\nmorphs = iterator.all()  # returns a list of results (up to the limit)\\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (sample):\\\")\\nfor m in morphs:\\n    print(f\\ID: {m.id}  |  Name: {m.name}  |  Brain region: \\\"\\n          f\\\"{getattr(m, 'brain_location', None) and getattr(m.brain_location, 'brain_region', None) and m.brain_location.brain_region.label}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Example: retrieve all morphologies (no explicit limit, iterator)\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import client as entity_client\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\nclient = entity_client.EntityClient()\\n\\n# Use limit=None to iterate over all matching entities\\niterator = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    limit=None  # iterate over entire result set (server-side paging handled by SDK)\\n)\\n\\ncount = 0\\nfor morph in iterator:\\n    count += 1\\n    print(f\\\"{count:4d} | ID: {morph.id} | Name: {morph.name}\\\")\\nprint(f\\Total retrieved: {count}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Example: paged query (explicit page & page_size)\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import client as entity_client\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\nclient = entity_client.EntityClient()\\n\\npage = 1\\npage_size = 50\\n\\n# The SDK accepts query dict parameters like \\page\\ and \\page_size\\\"\\nhits = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    query={\\page\\\": page, \\page_size\\\": page_size},\\n    limit=None\\n).all()\\n\\nprint(f\\Page {page} (size {page_size}) returned {len(hits)} items\\\")\\nfor m in hits:\\n    print(f\\ID: {m.id} | Name: {m.name}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Example: filtering by brain region or mtype\\n- Use query keys similar to examples in the docs:\\n  - Brain region by label: `\\brain_location__brain_region__label\\\": \\Primary motor cortex\\\"`\\n  - By mtype pref label: `\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\L5_TPC:A\\\"`\\n\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import client as entity_client\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\nclient = entity_client.EntityClient()\\n\\nquery = {\\n    \\brain_location__brain_region__label\\\": \\Primary motor cortex\\\",\\n    \\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\L5_TPC:A\\\"\\n}\\n\\niterator = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    query=query,\\n    limit=100  # retrieve up to 100 matching morphologies\\n)\\n\\nfor m in iterator:\\n    brain_region_label = (getattr(m, 'brain_location', None)\\n                          and getattr(m.brain_location, 'brain_region', None)\\n                          and m.brain_location.brain_region.label)\\n    print(f\\ID: {m.id} | Name: {m.name} | Brain region: {brain_region_label}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Notes and tips\\n- The SDK examples use `client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, ...)`.\\n- Use `limit=None` to let the SDK yield all results while it handles server-side paging for you.\\n- The query dictionary supports the same filter keys shown in examples: `mtype__pref_label`, `brain_location__brain_region__label`, `name__ilike`, and `page`/`page_size`.\\n- Inspect returned objects to find fields such as `id`, `name`, `description`, `assets`, `mtypes`, and `brain_location.brain_region.label`.\\n- Authentication/initialization of the client follows your environment/project configuration (the example assumes `EntityClient()` will pick that up).\\n\\nIf you want, I can now:\\n- provide a ready-to-run script that saves results to CSV; or\\n- show how to filter by a brain region UUID (hierarchy id) instead of label.

Which would you prefer: (A) list morphologies in this region, or (B) open a specific morphology (paste its name/ID)?",

    "expected_output": "## Single Cell Simulation Example (OBI-One)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step single-cell simulation example using the OBI-One Python API (openbraininstitute/obi-one). It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.

After I retrieve the docs, I'll provide a concise, runnable Python example and highlight key parameters.## Single-cell simulation example (obi-one)\\n\\nBelow is a minimal, self-contained Python example based on the official obi-one examples. It builds a small simulation form that initializes a single-cell circuit (provide a morphology/cell ID), injects a somatic current clamp, records the soma voltage, and validates the configuration.\\n\\nUsing the documentation snippets as a guide, the next step is to present a runnable example that mirrors the common blocks (info, neuron set, stimulus, recording, initialize) shown in the docs \\u2014 the code below follows that structure.\\n\\n```python\\n# Single-cell simulation example using obi-one\\nimport obi_one as obi\\n\\n# === Parameters ===\\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\\ninjection_amp = 0.5    # nA\\ninjection_delay = 10.0 # ms\\ninjection_duration = 100.0 # ms\\n\\n# === 1) Create empty simulation configuration ===\\nsim_conf = obi.CircuitSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\\n\\n# === 2) Metadata / Info ===\\ninfo = obi.Info(\\n    campaign_name=\\Single-Cell Test\\\",\\n    campaign_description=\\Single neuron current clamp + soma voltage recording\\\"\\n)\\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\\n\\n# === 3) Define a neuron set containing the single cell (IDNeuronSet) ===\\n# Replace the example neuron id below with an appropriate node id for your circuit,\\n# or use a PredefinedNeuronSet/AllNeurons depending on the circuit model.\\nid_neuron_set = obi.IDNeuronSet(\\n    neuron_ids=obi.NamedTuple(name=\\SingleID\\\", elements=(1,))  # single neuron id\\n)\\nsim_conf.add(id_neuron_set, name=\\single_neuron\\\")\\n\\n# === 4) Stimulus: somatic current clamp ===\\ncurrent_stim = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\\n    neuron_set=id_neuron_set.ref,\\n    amplitude=injection_amp,\\n    delay=injection_delay,\\n    duration=injection_duration\\n)\\nsim_conf.add(current_stim, name=\\somatic_current\\\")\\n\\n# === 5) Recording: soma voltage ===\\nsoma_record = obi.SomaVoltageRecording(\\n    neuron_set=id_neuron_set.ref,\\n    start_time=0.0,\\n    end_time=sim_duration\\n)\\nsim_conf.add(soma_record, name=\\soma_voltage\\\")\\n\\n# === 6) Initialization: point to the single-cell circuit (morphology / cell model) ===\\n# Option A: supply a CellMorphologyFromID (example from docs)\\n# Replace \\REPLACE_WITH_MORPHOLOGY_ID\\ with the real morphology UUID from your entitycore catalog.\\ninitialize = obi.CircuitSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\\n    circuit=[obi.CellMorphologyFromID(id_str=\\REPLACE_WITH_MORPHOLOGY_ID\\\")],\\n    node_set=id_neuron_set.ref,\\n    simulation_length=sim_duration,\\n    v_init=-80.0,               # initial membrane potential (mV)\\n    random_seed=42\\n)\\nsim_conf.set(initialize, name=\\initialize\\\")\\n\\n# === 7) Validate the configuration (produces the validated config object) ===\\nvalidated_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\\n\\n# Inspect the validated configuration (prints a summary representation)\\nprint(validated_conf)\\n```\\n\\n### What this does\\n- **Info**: Adds campaign metadata.\\n- **Neuron set**: Defines a single neuron (using **IDNeuronSet** with a single id).  \\n- **Stimulus**: Adds a somatic current clamp (**ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus**) to the neuron set.  \\n- **Recording**: Records soma voltage (**SomaVoltageRecording**) for the full simulation window.  \\n- **Initialize**: Points the simulation to a cell morphology / cell model using **CellMorphologyFromID** and sets basic initialization parameters (**simulation_length**, **v_init**, **random_seed**).  \\n- **validated_config()**: Produces a validated simulation configuration ready for downstream submission to the simulation service.\\n\\n### Notes and customization\\n- Replace **REPLACE_WITH_MORPHOLOGY_ID** with a valid morphology/cell UUID from your EntityCore catalog (or use a circuit ID / CircuitFromID if you have a complete circuit entity).  \\n- You can use **PredefinedNeuronSet** or **AllNeurons** instead of **IDNeuronSet** depending on how your circuit defines nodes.  \\n- Timestamps are optional for simple constant clamps; include a timestamps block if you want repeated/scan stimuli (see obi-one docs examples for scans).  \\n- After `validated_conf` you would normally submit this configuration to the simulation backend (the example stops at configuration validation).\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- adapt this example to use a real morphology/circuit ID from your project (provide the ID), or  \\n- show how to add timestamps for stimulus scanning, or  \\n- produce a version that records additional variables (e.g., compartment voltages or spikes).
