    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

If your SDK uses different method names, adjust accordingly.\\n\\n```python\\n# Install in advance: pip install openbraininstitute-entitysdk\\n\\nfrom openbraininstitute.entitysdk import EntitySDK  # adjust import if your package uses a different module path\\n\\n# Initialize the client (adjust parameter names to your SDK)\\nclient = EntitySDK(\\n    base_url=\\https://api.openbrainplatform.org\\\",  # replace with your instance\\n    api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\                       # or token, depending on the SDK\\n)\\n\\n# Fetch all cell morphologies\\n# If the SDK uses a resource-like structure, this is a common pattern:\\ntry:\\n    morphologies = client.cell_morphology.get_all(page=None, page_size=None)  # adjust to your SDK's API\\n    # If the SDK returns a list plus metadata, handle accordingly\\n    for m in morphologies.items:  # or morphologies, depending on the response shape\\n        print(f\\ID: {m.id}, Name: {m.name}, Description: {m.description}\\\")\\n        # Optional: print subject/species or other metadata if available\\n        if hasattr(m, \\subject\\\") and hasattr(m.subject, \\species\\\"):\\n            print(f\\  Species: {m.subject.species.name}\\\")\\nexcept Exception as e:\\n    print(f\\Error retrieving morphologies: {e}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nTips\\n- Pagination: if there are many morphologies, use `page` and `page_size` (e.g., `page=1, page_size=100`) and loop until you\\u2019ve exhausted all pages.\\n- Filtering: you can often filter by fields like name, species, brain region, or author. Check the SDK docs for exact filter parameters (e.g., `name__ilike`, `subject__species__name`, etc.).\\n- Response shape: some SDKs return a dict with `items` and `total_items`; others return a list. Adapt the iteration accordingly.\\n\\nIf you have the exact SDK documentation or a quick snippet of how the SDK exposes the cell morphology endpoint (e.g., method names, return types), I can tailor the code precisely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2) RESTful alternative (using requests)\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t have the SDK handy, you can list morphologies via a REST call.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n- Install requests: `pip install requests`\\n- Base URL and API key as above\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```python\\nimport requests\\n\\nBASE_URL = \\https://api.openbrainplatform.org\\  # adjust\\nAPI_KEY = \\YOUR_API_KEY\\\"\\n\\nheaders = {\\n    \\Authorization\\\": f\\Bearer {API_KEY}\\\",\\n    \\Accept\\\": \\application/json\\\",\\n}\\n\\ndef list_cell_morphologies(page=1, page_size=100):\\n    url = f\\\"{BASE_URL}/cell-morphologies\\  # adjust to your actual endpoint path\\n    params = {\\page\\\": page, \\page_size\\\": page_size}\\n    resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)\\n    resp.raise_for_status()\\n    return resp.json()\\n\\n# Example usage\\npage = 1\\nwhile True:\\n    data = list_cell_morphologies(page=page, page_size=100)\\n    items = data.get(\\items\\\", data.get(\\morphologies\\\", []))\\n    for m in items:\\n        print(f\\ID: {m.get('id')}, Name: {m.get('name')}, Description: {m.get('description')}\\\")\\n    total = data.get(\\total_items\\\", data.get(\\total\\\", 0))\\n    if page * 100 >= total:\\n        break\\n    page += 1\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What you\\u2019ll typically get back\\n\\n- Each morphology entry might include:\\n  - ID, name, description\\n  - Brain region or site\\n  - Subject species\\n  - Morphology measurements (e.g., soma size, dendritic lengths)\\n  - Metadata like creation/update dates, author, protocol\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Want me to tailor the code?\\n\\nIf you can share:\\n- The exact SDK package name you\\u2019re using\\n- The function/method names for listing morphologies in your SDK\\n- A sample response shape (or a quick snippet)\\n\\nI\\u2019ll provide a drop-in, fully tested snippet matching your environment.",

I list the citation, a short summary of the main morphological findings, and a link to the paper (DOI/URL). Where the search tool returned a figure image URL I embedded it.\\n\\n### 1) Neuronal diversity and stereotypy at multiple scales through whole brain morphometry (Peng et al., 2024)\\n- **Citation / Link:** [Neuronal diversity and stereotypy at multiple scales through whole brain morphometry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54745-6)  \\n- **Summary:** Large-scale whole\\u2011brain morphometry in mouse: registered 204 mouse brains to the Allen CCF, annotated ~182k cell bodies, modeled dendritic microenvironments and full morphology for ~1,876 neurons, and detected ~2.6M axonal varicosities. Multi-scale quantification of neuronal diversity and stereotypy across dendritic/axonal features and sub\\u2011neuronal motifs.

It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.

Replace the placeholder IDs and paths with your project-specific values.\\n\\n> NOTE: fill in the ME-model ID and any project paths where indicated.\\n\\n### Python example\\n\\n```python\\n# Example: single_cell_simulation.py\\nimport obi_one as obi\\n\\n# 1) Select the ME-Model to simulate\\n# Replace with a real ME-Model UUID from EntityCore (or use a discovery step)\\nME_MODEL_ID = \\\"<YOUR_MEMODEL_UUID>\\\"\\n\\n# The ME-Model reference used in the single-neuron config\\nme_model_ref = obi.Reference(kind=\\me_model\\\", id=ME_MODEL_ID)  # pattern used in obi_one examples\\n\\n# 2) Create simulation metadata (campaign info)\\ninfo = obi.Info(\\n    campaign_name=\\Single cell current clamp test\\\",\\n    campaign_description=\\Test single-cell response to somatic current steps\\\"\\n)\\n\\n# 3) Define timestamps / stimulation schedule\\n# here: single stimulus starting at 100.0 ms\\ntimestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(\\n    start_time=100.0,\\n    interval=1000.0,\\n    number_of_repetitions=1\\n)\\n\\n# 4) Define the neuron set - single neuron (ID 0) for an ME-model single-cell simulation\\n# Two common patterns:\\n# - Use IDNeuronSet when simulating a list of neuron instances\\nsingle_neuron_set = obi.IDNeuronSet(neuron_ids=obi.NamedTuple(name=\\single\\\", elements=[0]))\\n\\n# 5) Define a constant current clamp stimulus (somatic)\\ni_stim = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\\n    timestamps=timestamps.ref,\\n    neuron_set=single_neuron_set.ref,\\n    duration=200.0,       # ms\\n    amplitude=0.3,        # nA\\n    timestamp_offset=0.0\\n)\\n\\n# 6) Define recordings - soma voltage\\nvoltage_rec = obi.SomaVoltageRecording(\\n    timestamps=timestamps.ref,\\n    neuron_set=single_neuron_set.ref,\\n    start_time=0.0,\\n    end_time=500.0\\n)\\n\\n# 7) Build single-neuron simulation configuration\\n# There are multiple config builders in obi_one; use the single-neuron config form/pattern\\nsingle_conf = obi.SingleNeuronSimulationConfig.empty_config()  # typical factory pattern in obi_one\\n\\nsingle_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\\nsingle_conf.add(single_neuron_set, name=\\SingleNeuronSet\\\")\\nsingle_conf.add(timestamps, name=\\Timestamps\\\")\\nsingle_conf.add(i_stim, name=\\IStimulus\\\")\\nsingle_conf.add(voltage_rec, name=\\VoltageRecording\\\")\\n\\n# Attach the ME-model reference (model to be instantiated for the single neuron)\\n# The precise mechanism can be either part of Initialize or a top-level field depending on version:\\ninitialize = obi.SingleNeuronSimulationConfig.Initialize(\\n    me_model=me_model_ref,\\n    node_set=single_neuron_set.ref,\\n    simulation_length=single_conf.records()[\\VoltageRecording\\\"].end_time if hasattr(single_conf, \\records\\\") else 500.0\\n)\\nsingle_conf.set(initialize, name=\\initialize\\\")\\n\\n# 8) Validate the configuration (ensures required pieces are present)\\nvalidated_conf = single_conf.validated_config()\\n\\n# 9) (Optional) Run the simulation via obi_one runtime (or export config for remote runner)\\n# Two common patterns:\\n# - Local runner:\\nrunner = obi.SingleNeuronRunner()\\nresult = runner.run(validated_conf)\\n\\n# - Or export config and submit to your platform's simulation service\\n# validated_conf.to_json(\\single_neuron_conf.json\\\")\\n\\n# 10) Inspect / save results\\n# Example result access pattern (depends on runtime):\\nif result.status == \\success\\\":\\n    traces = result.get_voltage_traces()  # API names vary; check runner's return object\\n    # traces typically a dict: {neuron_id: { \\timestamps\\\": [...], \\voltage\\\": [...] } }\\n    print(\\Simulation finished, traces available for neuron 0\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\Simulation failed:\\\", result.status)\\n```\\n\\n### Key steps and mapping to `obi_one` components\\n- **ME-Model selection**: supply an ME-model UUID (from EntityCore). You can discover ME-Models using the EntityCore search API or the examples that list available ME-Models.\\n- **Timestamps**: use `RegularTimestamps` to schedule stimulation windows.\\n- **Neuron set**: for a single-cell simulation use an `IDNeuronSet` with a single element (often 0) or the appropriate pattern used by your ME-model runner.\\n- **Stimulus**: `ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus` injects current at soma (supports scalar or scan vectors).\\n- **Recordings**: `SomaVoltageRecording` to capture membrane potential.\\n- **Configuration**: use the SingleNeuron config factory, attach initialize block with the ME-model and node set, validate, then run or export.\\n- **Execution**: either run locally with an obi_one runner (if available) or export and submit to your compute environment.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Provide a runnable notebook example tailored to a specific ME-Model ID you supply.\\n- Show how to discover available ME-Models from EntityCore and pick one programmatically.\\n- Convert this example into a Plotly plot of the resulting voltage trace (requires running the simulation).",
