    "ai_response": "## Short answer\\n\\nYou can run simulations on the Open Brain Platform by creating or selecting a circuit (single neuron, pair, microcircuit, region, system, or whole-brain), configuring the simulation parameters and models (ME-models, e-models, synaptome, inputs, recording probes, etc.), and submitting the run. The platform provides ready-made digital models, configurable notebooks, and simulation jobs that you can launch and monitor.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed overview (what you can do and typical workflow)\\n\\n### 1) Choose a simulation scale and purpose\\n- **Single neuron** \\u2014 test ionic mechanisms, current injections, spike shapes.\\n- **Pair** \\u2014 study connectivity between two identified neurons.\\n- **Small / Microcircuit** \\u2014 investigate motifs or small networks with intrinsic/extrinsic connectivity.\\n- **Region / System / Whole brain** \\u2014 atlas-driven circuit simulations using population models, connectivity, and synaptome.\\n\\n### 2) Select or build the model components\\n- **ME-models** (morphology + electrical): pick a neuron ME-model or set of ME-models for the neurons you want to simulate.\\n- **E-models**: electrical templates used to represent neuron electrical types.\\n- **Morphologies**: choose morphologies to use as exemplars or distributions.\\n- **Synaptome / Connectivity**: define synapse distributions, connection probabilities and rules for network runs.\\n- **Ion channel sets and densities, bouton/synapse densities** as applicable.\\n\\n### 3) Configure the simulation\\n- Define **stimuli** (current clamps, synaptic inputs, spike trains, background noise).\\n- Choose **recordings** (somatic voltage, dendritic voltages, spike times, synaptic currents).\\n- Set **simulation runtime**, **time step (dt)**, temperature and other physics parameters.\\n- For network runs: set **population sizes**, **spatial extents**, **connectivity rules**, and external inputs.\\n\\n### 4) Use the platform\\u2019s tools/notebooks\\n- The platform provides interactive notebooks (single-neuron, synaptome, microcircuit, metabolism/NGV) to build and run experiments and analyze results.\\n- Notebooks let you modify model parameters, run trials, and plot outputs.\\n\\n### 5) Submit and monitor the job\\n- Submit the configured simulation job.\\n- Monitor job status (queued / running / done / failure).\\n- Retrieve results and visualizations when complete.\\n\\n### 6) Analyze and iterate\\n- Inspect voltages, spike rasters, synaptic currents, or derived metrics.\\n- Modify parameters (channel densities, connectivity, inputs) and re-run to explore hypotheses.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Practical tips\\n- Start small: run single-neuron simulations first to validate ion channels/emodels before scaling up.\\n- Use authorized public ME-models / templates to get quick, validated starting points.\\n- Save configurations so you can reproduce or vary parameters across runs.\\n- Use the platform\\u2019s notebooks for pre-built analysis pipelines and plots.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Need help with a specific simulation?\\nIf you want, tell me:\\n- Which circuit scale (single, pair, microcircuit, region, system, whole_brain)\\n- Any existing circuit ID you want to use (if you have one)\\n- Which models (ME-models, e-models) or brain region(s)\\n- The main goal (e.g., test Ih channel effect on firing, run a 1-second microcircuit with Poisson background)\\n\\nI can then generate a complete simulation configuration JSON for the circuit using the platform simulation-config generator. (If you want that, provide the circuit ID or tell me to create a new configuration for you.)",
