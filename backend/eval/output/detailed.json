If you want, I can open any of the tutorial videos or walk you through a specific simulation type interactively.\\n\\n### Quick overview (workflow)\\n1. **Create a Virtual Lab and Project**\\n   - Create a Virtual Lab (admin email verification required).\\n   - Create one or more Projects inside your Virtual Lab.\\n   - Add credits to your Project (transfer from Virtual Lab credit balance).\\n\\n2. **Build or select a model**\\n   - For single-neuron work: build an M-E model by selecting a morphology (M model) and an electrical model (E model). Save as an ME-model.\\n   - For other scales (synaptome, microcircuit, region, etc.) choose or build the appropriate circuit components (morphologies, e-models, connectivity, synapses, etc.).\\n\\n3. **Prepare the simulation**\\n   - Go to your Project \\u2192 Simulate.\\n   - Choose the simulation type (Single Neuron, Synaptome, Microcircuit, Region, System, Whole-brain depending on availability and credits).\\n   - Select the model(s) to simulate, set experimental protocol (stimuli, current injections, network inputs), and choose recording locations/variables.\\n   - Configure simulation parameters (duration, time step, seed/randomization, parallelization if available).\\n\\n4. **Run the simulation**\\n   - Submit the simulation. It consumes credits from the selected Project.\\n   - Monitor status (created \\u2192 pending \\u2192 running \\u2192 done / error).\\n\\n5. **Inspect and save results**\\n   - Open the Results tab to view traces, spiking, voltages, synaptic events, population measures, or derived metrics.\\n   - Save recordings or export data to your Project library for later analysis or reuse.\\n\\n6. **Iterate**\\n   - Modify model parameters or protocols and re-run as needed.\\n   - Use saved simulations as templates for batch runs or parameter sweeps.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Official tutorial videos (from platform)\\n- **How to explore** \\u2014 Overview of browsing data and models.  \\n  [How to explore (video)](https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/1086317704/rendition/2160p/file.mp4?loc=external&log_user=0&signature=a48bdfd7c6ed6c7fd9ac34c62b5d901cbb591f8ea2ed3521848ed097a08ed83a)\\n\\n- **How to get started** \\u2014 Create Virtual Lab, Project, and transfer credits.  \\n  [How to get started (video)](https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/1086084238/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external&log_user=0&signature=75d9815793616bde14f32a62c1a0308a68c6ba1937a3563d3e62f276fc05e697)\\n\\n- **How to simulate a single neuron model** \\u2014 Build an M-E model and run single-neuron simulations.  \\n  [How to simulate a single neuron model (video)](https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/1086083921/rendition/2160p/file.mp4?loc=external&log_user=0&signature=3a7aea8250d7f90f11ca86e4334c8ac83af938ea8bfe5f4bcaf03e7f29e588d5)\\n\\n(total_items: 3)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Need help with a specific simulation?\\nTell me which of these you want to do and I will generate a detailed step-by-step plan or create a simulation configuration for you:\\n- Build & simulate a single neuron (give brain region / desired M & E types)\\n- Run a parameter sweep (e.g., current amplitude, conductance values)\\n- Create and simulate a microcircuit or synaptome\\n- Inspect or analyze existing simulation results\\n\\nIf you want me to generate a simulation JSON config for a specific circuit, provide the target circuit ID (UUID) and a full description of the final configuration you want, and I will call the simulator-config generator to produce the JSON.",
