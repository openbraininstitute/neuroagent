Behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) accompanies both formation and retrieval, suggesting repeated re-formation of stable place cells via synaptic plasticity rather than permanent synaptic weight fixing.  \\n- ![Figure from Magee et al. 2025](https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41593-025-01986-3/MediaObjects/41593_2025_1986_Fig1_HTML.png)  \\n  *Alt text:* Example figure from Magee et al., 2025 showing hippocampal place-cell analysis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2) **Synaptic basis of feature selectivity in hippocampal neurons**  \\n- **Authors:** Kevin C.

The study links synaptic changes to the emergence of place-field-like feature selectivity in CA1 pyramidal neurons, providing direct synaptic-level evidence for how plasticity shapes receptive fields during behavior.  \\n- ![Figure from Losonczy et al. 2024](https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-08325-9/MediaObjects/41586_2024_8325_Fig1_HTML.png)  \\n  *Alt text:* Example figure from Losonczy et al., 2024 showing all-optical synaptic measurements.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNotes and next steps\\n\\n- These search results include the key recent experimental studies linking synaptic plasticity mechanisms to hippocampal place-field formation and memory representation.

    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

These snippets assume you already have an authenticated `client` object (the examples in the docs use a pre-configured `client` variable).\\n\\n### Quick explanation of the approach\\nUse the `client.search_entity` helper with `entity_type=models.CellMorphology` and optional query / pagination parameters. Results are returned as an iterator you can iterate over or convert to a list.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1) Retrieve a limited number (e.g., 10) of cell morphologies\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\n# Retrieve up to 10 CellMorphology entities\\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\\n\\nprint(\\Retrieved:\\\", len(morphs))\\nfor m in morphs:\\n    print(f\\ID: {m.id}  Name: {m.name}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2) Search by name (case-insensitive, SQL ILIKE pattern)\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\n# Case-insensitive name search; supports wildcard patterns like '%my-morph%'\\nhits = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    query={\\name__ilike\\\": \\my-morph\\\"},   # adjust pattern as needed\\n    query_extra={\\page\\\": 1, \\page_size\\\": 2},  # optional pagination controls\\n    limit=None   # use None to allow retrieving more (see notes below)\\n).all()\\n\\nprint(\\Number of results:\\\", len(hits))\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3) Filter by mtype preferred label (example: 'SR_PC' or 'L5_TPC:A')\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\nmorphs = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"},\\n    limit=50\\n).all()\\n\\nfor m in morphs:\\n    print(m.id, m.name, m.mtype)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4) Iterate results without collecting into memory\\nIf you expect many results and want to stream them instead of loading all at once:\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\niterator = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, limit=None)\\n\\nfor m in iterator:\\n    # process each morphology one at a time\\n    print(m.id, m.name)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Practical notes and tips\\n- **Limit vs. pagination**: Setting `limit=None` lets the iterator fetch as many results as the API will provide; you can also use `page`/`page_size` in the `query` (or `query_extra`) for manual pagination.\\n- **Common filter keys** (from docs): `name__ilike`, `mtype__pref_label`, `subject__species__name`, and many other entity fields \\u2014 pass them in the `query` dictionary.\\n- **Fields returned**: Each returned `CellMorphology` object includes `.id`, `.name`, `.description`, `.mtype`, measurement metadata, and other attributes documented in the entitysdk models.\\n- **Memory**: Use the iterator approach for large result sets to avoid storing everything in memory.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Show an example that restricts morphologies to a specific brain region (need the brain region ID), or\\n- Provide a complete example including client creation/authentication steps (tell me how you authenticate or which auth method you use).",

If you want, I can now compute a concrete cost estimate for a specific simulation (tell me plan, model type, biological time and number of neurons) and convert credits into money using your subscription details.\\n\\n## Plans returned (total_items: 4)\\n- **Free**\\n- **Pro**\\n- **Education**\\n- **Enterprise**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Simulation costs by plan\\n\\n### **Free**\\n- **E-model:** **1 credit / simulation**  \\n- **Ion channel:** **1 credit / simulation**  \\n- **Single cell:** **1 credit / simulation**  \\n- **Synaptome:** **1 credit / simulation**  \\n- **Small microcircuit (\\u2264 10 neurons):** **10 credits / simulation**  \\n- **Microcircuit (>10 neurons):** **0.05 credits / neuron / second of biological time**\\n\\nAdditional Free-plan notes:\\n- **100 free initial credits** (expires in 1 year, non-transferable)\\n- **1 GB private free storage** (retained 3 months after cancellation)\\n- **AI queries:** 30 free queries per 24 h, then **1 credit / query**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Pro** (subscription required)\\n- **E-model:** **0.5 credits / simulation**  \\n- **Ion channel:** **0.5 credits / simulation**  \\n- **Single cell:** **0.5 credits / simulation**  \\n- **Synaptome:** **0.5 credits / simulation**  \\n- **Small microcircuit (\\u2264 10 neurons):** **5 credits / simulation**  \\n- **Microcircuit (>10 neurons):** **0.025 credits / neuron / second of biological time**\\n\\nPro subscription highlights:\\n- Monthly: **CHF 25** (includes **50 free credits / month**)  \\n- Yearly: **CHF 275** (includes **650 free credits / year**)  \\n- **Running notebooks:** 2 credits / hour (for reference)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Education**\\n- Plan page indicates tailored education offerings; simulation cost lines are not enumerated in the retrieved fields. Education includes compute credits for teaching and a contact button for details.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Enterprise**\\n- Enterprise is a custom plan. Pricing and simulate_features are not listed in the returned fields; enterprise offers scalable compute & storage and requires contacting sales for custom options.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to get a concrete cost in CHF (recommended next step)\\nNow that you have the per-credit simulation rates, the next step is to convert credits to CHF for your case using either:\\n- your current subscription (e.g., Pro includes free credits and a CHF price per subscription), or\\n- purchasing credits (Enterprise/Education teams may have custom pricing).\\n\\nTell me which plan you use (Free, Pro, Education, Enterprise) and the simulation details:\\n- model type (E-model / single cell / microcircuit / synaptome / ion channel)\\n- for microcircuits: number of neurons and biological time (seconds)\\nWith that I will compute the credit cost and\\u2014if you use Pro or have a known credit-to-CHF conversion\\u2014translate it to CHF.",

    "expected_output": "## Single Cell Simulation Example (OBI-One)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step single-cell simulation example using the OBI-One Python API (openbraininstitute/obi-one). It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.
