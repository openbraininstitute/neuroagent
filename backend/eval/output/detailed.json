    "ai_response": "## Overview \\u2014 How to run simulations on the Open Brain Platform\\n\\nBelow I outline the typical end-to-end workflow for running simulations on the Open Brain Platform, the types of simulations supported, and practical tips to get started quickly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1) Simulation types available\\n- **Single-neuron simulations** \\u2014 electrophysiology models (e-models) and morphologically-detailed models (me-models). Good for ionic currents, spike dynamics, channel mechanisms.\\n- **Small circuits / microcircuits** \\u2014 networks from a few to dozens of neurons with defined connectivity motifs.\\n- **Region / system / whole-brain circuits** \\u2014 atlas-driven large-scale circuits (region, system, whole_brain scales) built from cellular densities, connectivity and synaptome data.\\n- **Metabolism and NGV notebooks** \\u2014 metabolic and neuron-glia-vasculature notebooks available as runnable notebooks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2) Typical workflow (step-by-step)\\n\\n### A. Choose or create a circuit\\n- Pick an existing circuit from the platform (public circuits or your projects) or assemble one:\\n  - Single neuron: select or upload a *me-model* (morphology + electrical model).\\n  - Microcircuit/region: choose the brain region, species, and cell types or import a prepared circuit JSON.\\n- For atlas-based circuits, first identify the brain region(s) you want to simulate.\\n\\n### B. Resolve brain region IDs (atlas-based simulations)\\n- The platform is atlas-driven. Always resolve brain region names to their unique platform IDs before querying or building region models.\\n- Use the brain-region lookup (EntityCore) to get the UUID of the brain region; once you have that UUID, use it for all subsequent region-limited queries.\\n\\n### C. Configure the simulation\\n- Define simulation parameters:\\n  - Duration (ms / s)\\n  - Time resolution (dt)\\n  - Inputs (current injection, synaptic drive, background noise)\\n  - Temperature, ionic concentrations (if applicable)\\n  - Recording targets (voltage at soma, dendrites, spike times, synaptic currents)\\n- Select model variants:\\n  - Choose the e-model (electrical parameterization) and/or morphology (SWC) to pair into an me-model.\\n  - For networks: choose connectivity rules (probabilistic, distance-dependent, cell-type-specific), synaptic kinetics, and plasticity rules if needed.\\n\\n### D. Generate the simulation configuration\\n- Use the platform\\u2019s simulation configuration builder or the simulation-config generator to produce the final JSON/YAML configuration that the simulator understands.\\n- If modifying an existing configuration, always produce the complete desired configuration (not just diffs).\\n\\n### E. Validate the configuration\\n- Validate model references (IDs for me-models, emodels, morphologies), check that brain region UUIDs are used where required.\\n- Confirm recorders and outputs are properly specified.\\n\\n### F. Run the simulation\\n- Submit the configuration to the platform\\u2019s simulation runner. Options typically include:\\n  - Local / notebook execution (downloadable notebook to run remotely)\\n  - Platform-managed execution (queued run on the platform compute backend)\\n- Monitor run status (started / running / done / error). For single neuron simulations, check for successful completion and logs.\\n\\n### G. Retrieve and analyze results\\n- Download output files (voltage traces, spike times, summary metrics).\\n- Use platform notebooks or your analysis tools to visualize raster plots, membrane potential traces, firing rates, spectral analysis, etc.\\n- Iteratively adjust parameters and rerun as needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3) Tools & APIs you will use on the platform\\n- Simulation builder / GUI (for interactive config assembly)\\n- Simulation configuration generator (LLM-assisted JSON generator used by the platform) \\u2014 when requesting config generation, provide a full description of the desired final configuration (including circuit_id).\\n- EntityCore endpoints to list and retrieve:\\n  - me-models, e-models, morphologies, single-neuron-simulations and simulations\\n  - brain region IDs (mandatory for region-based queries)\\n- Download APIs and asset download endpoints for retrieving run outputs and assets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4) Practical tips & best practices\\n- Always use UUIDs (IDs) for brain regions, circuits, me-models, and other entities in configs\\u2014do not rely on names in configs.\\n- For reproducibility: store and export the full simulation config (JSON) with run metadata (versions, date, author).\\n- Start simple: test single-neuron runs before scaling to networks.\\n- Use small dt and validate numerical stability for detailed ion-channel models.\\n- Check available compute quotas and expected runtime for large region/system simulations.\\n- Use platform notebooks (examples) \\u2014 many templates exist (single neuron, synaptome, metabolism) that you can modify.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5) If you want, I can:\\n- Help assemble a complete simulation configuration JSON for a specific goal (you must provide or pick a circuit_id). I will then call the platform\\u2019s configuration generator to produce it.\\n- Lookup brain region UUIDs and available me-models or e-models for a given species/region.\\n- Walk through running a single neuron simulation step-by-step with example parameters.\\n\\nTell me which simulation scale (single neuron / microcircuit / region / whole brain) and the species/brain region or circuit_id you want to simulate and I will generate the complete configuration and next steps.",
