    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

Annotated ~182k cell bodies, modeled >15k dendritic microenvironments and ~1,876 full neuron morphologies, plus ~2.63M axonal varicosities (putative boutons). Provides multi-scale datasets (cell, dendritic microenvironment, full morphology, axonal motifs) registered to the Allen CCF. Emphasizes diversity vs. stereotypy across scales.  \\n- **Link:** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54745-6  \\n- **Key resource:** PDF available from article page.  \\n![Fig from Peng et al. 2024](https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-54745-6/MediaObjects/41467_2024_54745_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2) A Multi-Scale Neuron Morphometry Dataset from Peta-voxel Mouse Whole-Brain Images  \\n- **Authors:** Peng, Hanchuan et al.  \\n- **Journal / Date:** Scientific Data \\u2014 23 Apr 2025  \\n- **Summary:** Dataset paper accompanying peta\\u2011voxel whole\\u2011brain imaging and morphometry workflows. Describes production pipeline, data formats, and access to the large multi-scale morphometry dataset (registered to Allen CCF). Valuable for cross-scale morphological analyses and method re-use.  \\n- **Link:** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04379-0  \\n![Fig from Peng et al. 2025 dataset paper](https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41597-025-04379-0/MediaObjects/41597_2025_4379_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3) An unsupervised map of excitatory neuron dendritic morphology in the mouse visual cortex  \\n- **Authors:** Ecker, Alexander S. et al.  \\n- **Journal / Date:** Nature Communications \\u2014 9 Apr 2025  \\n- **Summary:** Data\\u2011driven, unsupervised mapping of dendritic morphologies of >30,000 excitatory neurons from MICrONS serial EM data in mouse visual cortex. Suggests cortical excitatory dendritic morphologies form a continuum (axes of variation) rather than discrete m\\u2011types, with layer\\u2011 and area\\u2011specific trends. Important for rethinking morphological classification.  \\n- **Link:** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58763-w  \\n![Fig from Ecker et al. 2025](https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-58763-w/MediaObjects/41467_2025_58763_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4) Variation and convergence in the morpho-functional properties of the mammalian neocortex (Review)  \\n- **Author:** S\\u00e9verine Mahon  \\n- **Journal / Date:** Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience \\u2014 20 Jun 2024  \\n- **Summary:** Comparative review of neocortical neuron structure and function across mammals. Discusses how morphological features (dendritic length, spine density, arborization) scale with brain size and highlights conserved versus species\\u2011specific adaptations. Useful for evolutionary / comparative perspective.  \\n- **Link / DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1413780  \\n![Fig from Mahon 2024 review](https://images-provider.frontiersin.org/api/ipx/w=1200&f=png/https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1413780/fnsys-18-1413780-HTML/image_m/fnsys-18-1413780-g001.jpg)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5) Modeling and Simulation of Neocortical Micro- and Mesocircuitry. Part I: Anatomy (preprint / model resource)  \\n- **Authors:** Abdellah M., Hernando J., Eilemann S., Lapere S., Antille N., Markram H., Sch\\u00fcrmann F.  \\n- **Date:** Aug 2024 (eLife reviewed preprint)  \\n- **Summary:** Large-scale data\\u2011driven anatomical model of juvenile rat somatosensory cortex with ~4.2M morphologically and biophysically detailed neurons placed in an atlas and connected by ~14.2B synapses. Focuses on anatomical realism and limits of deducing connectivity from anatomy. Includes openly available subvolumes for simulation. Relevant for how morphology is used in large\\u2011scale circuit models.  \\n- **Link:** https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/99688v1/pdf\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6) Cell class-specific long-range axonal projections of neurons in mouse whisker-related somatosensory cortices (preprint)  \\n- **Authors:** Aronoff R., Petersen C.C.H.  \\n- **Date:** May 2024 (eLife reviewed preprint)  \\n- **Summary:** Brain\\u2011wide light\\u2011sheet imaging of genetically labeled projection neurons; quantifies layer/subclass-specific long-range axonal outputs from whisker somatosensory cortex. Demonstrates how morphological projection patterns map onto functional connectivity. Useful for linking soma/layer location and axonal morphology to circuit function.  \\n- **Link:** https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/97602v1/pdf\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Which of these would you like next?\\n- I can fetch the full text / PDFs for any of the open articles using the read\\u2011paper tool (if publicly available).  \\n- I can extract figures, methods, or specific morphological measurements (e.g., dendritic length, branching statistics, bouton counts) from a chosen paper.  \\n- I can search specifically for human cerebrum morphology studies, or for morphological analyses of particular cell types (pyramidal cells, interneurons, L5 vs L2/3) or modalities (EM reconstructions, light-sheet, tracing).\\n\\nIf you want full\\u2011text extraction for any of the above, tell me which paper(s) and I\\u2019ll attempt to retrieve them.",

    "ai_response": "## Overview \\u2014 how simulation works on the Open Brain Platform\\n\\nSimulations on the Open Brain Platform are model-driven experiments you create from a digital circuit (single neuron, microcircuit, region, etc.). The typical workflow is:\\n\\n1. Select or build a circuit (an existing circuit or a circuit you create from atlas / neuron data).  \\n2. Create a simulation configuration describing initialization, stimuli, recordings, and any manipulations.  \\n3. Launch the simulation (the platform schedules and runs it).  \\n4. Monitor progress and inspect results (spike trains, voltages, population summaries, saved artifacts).  \\n5. Iterate: modify parameters, stimuli, or circuit composition as needed.\\n\\nBelow I give a practical, step-by-step guide and notes on the options you\\u2019ll commonly use.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What you need before running a simulation\\n\\n- **Circuit ID** (UUID) or choose/create a circuit on the platform. Circuits have scales such as *single*, *pair*, *microcircuit*, *region*, etc.  \\n- An idea of what you want to measure (e.g., membrane potential traces, spikes, population firing rates, synaptic currents).  \\n- Any experiment-specific manipulations: synaptic blockers, changes in extracellular calcium, optogenetic stimuli, changed connection probabilities, etc.\\n\\nIf you want, I can help construct the simulation configuration for a given circuit \\u2014 just provide the circuit UUID and what you want to do.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Types of simulations you can run\\n\\n- **Single-neuron simulations**: intracellular current steps, channel perturbations, I\\u2013V curves.  \\n- **Paired neuron / small circuits**: synaptic pairing, paired-pulse, STDP protocols.  \\n- **Microcircuit simulations** (20+ cells): network dynamics, population responses, brief stimuli.  \\n- **Region / system simulations**: large-scale network activity, LFP proxies, population statistics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key configuration components (what to specify)\\n\\nWhen you create a simulation config you usually specify only the things that differ from defaults. Typical fields you will set:\\n\\n- **initialize**  \\n  - type (e.g., deterministic / randomized)  \\n  - v_init (resting membrane potential)  \\n  - extracellular calcium concentration (if relevant)  \\n  - random_seed (for reproducibility)  \\n- **simulation length** (ms or seconds)  \\n- **neuron_sets / node_sets** \\u2014 which neuron populations to include/record from (IDs or labels)  \\n- **stimuli**  \\n  - current clamps, synaptic inputs, optogenetic drives  \\n  - timing, amplitude, waveform  \\n- **recordings**  \\n  - what to record (spikes, somatic Vm, compartments, synaptic currents)  \\n  - sampling frequency / channels to store  \\n- **synaptic_manipulations** (optional)  \\n  - block or scale particular synapse types, change weights, change delays  \\n- **timestamps / metadata**  \\n  - campaign name, description, tags for provenance\\n\\nNote: The platform provides reasonable defaults for many parameters; you only need to override items important for your experiment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to create a valid simulation configuration (programmatic / API)\\n\\n- The platform expects a structured simulation configuration (JSON).  \\n- There is a helper tool on the platform that generates a valid config from a natural-language description \\u2014 it will fill defaults and ensure the JSON is valid. If you want, tell me: (a) the circuit UUID, and (b) a short description of the experiment (stimulus, recordings, duration, any manipulations). I can generate the config for you.\\n\\nIf you want me to do that now, please provide the circuit UUID and a brief description of exactly what you want to simulate.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Launching, monitoring, and retrieving results\\n\\n- Once the config is submitted, the platform schedules the job and runs it.  \\n- You can monitor status (queued, running, success/failure) and view logs/status messages (the platform exposes simulation metadata and timestamps).  \\n- After completion, results are stored as simulation artifacts: time series, spike lists, summary files, and plots. You can download them or use built-in viewers and analysis notebooks.\\n\\nProgrammatic endpoints exist to list simulations, get one simulation\\u2019s details, and list single-neuron simulations; these let you fetch metadata and results programmatically.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Best practices and tips\\n\\n- Use a fixed random seed for reproducibility if you need exact repeats.  \\n- Start with short runs or fewer recorded channels to debug config and stimuli before launching a long, expensive run.  \\n- Record only the variables you need (high sampling / many compartments increases storage and runtime).  \\n- Use population-level recordings (mean firing rates, LFP proxies) when scaling up to large circuits to reduce storage.  \\n- Keep a clear metadata/campaign description for provenance and sharing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Common pitfalls\\n\\n- Forgetting to set the correct node_set / neuron_set ids \\u2014 the simulation may run but record nothing.  \\n- Overly long simulation time or too many recorded traces leads to large outputs and slow transfer.  \\n- Not setting initial conditions (v_init) when you expect a particular baseline state.  \\n- Not specifying the extracellular calcium or receptor-specific manipulations when testing synaptic scaling.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What I can do for you right now\\n\\n- Generate a complete simulation configuration if you give me:\\n  - **Circuit UUID** (required)  \\n  - Short description: simulation length, stimuli (type, timing, amplitude), recordings you want (spikes, Vm, specific populations), and any manipulations (synapse block, calcium change, random_seed).  \\n- Review an existing simulation config and suggest optimizations.  \\n- Explain how to interpret common outputs (raster plots, firing-rate histograms, Vm traces).\\n\\nI can\\u2019t see or interact with the platform UI itself, so I won\\u2019t be able to walk you through buttons or screens. If you want me to generate a simulation config now, paste the circuit UUID and describe the experiment you\\u2019d like to run.",

    "expected_output": "## Single Cell Simulation Example (OBI-One)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step single-cell simulation example using the OBI-One Python API (openbraininstitute/obi-one). It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.
