    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

Now I'll retrieve the OBI documentation for the entitysdk package.Reasoning: To give a clear, working recipe I will show how to authenticate and create an EntitySDK client, then demonstrate listing morphologies both unfiltered and with filters (brain region / species) and how to handle pagination/counts using the iterator API returned by client.search_entity.\\n\\n## Overview\\nBelow is a concise, idiomatic Python example using the EntitySDK to list cell morphologies. It shows:\\n- token management (environment variable)\\n- client creation\\n- listing all morphologies (handling pagination via the iterator)\\n- filtering by brain region label and species\\n- counting results / inspecting partial previews\\n\\nRelevant references:\\n- Example client initialization: [examples/02_morphology.ipynb](https://github.com/openbraininstitute/entitysdk/blob/main/examples/02_morphology.ipynb)  \\n- Searching examples: [examples/01_searching.ipynb](https://github.com/openbraininstitute/entitysdk/blob/main/examples/01_searching.ipynb)\\n\\n## Example code\\n\\n```python\\n# Example: list cell morphologies using entitysdk\\n# Requirements: pip install entitysdk\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom entitysdk.client import Client\\nfrom entitysdk.common import ProjectContext\\nfrom entitysdk.token_manager import TokenFromEnv\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\n# -------------------------\\n# Authentication and client\\n# -------------------------\\n# Put your JWT/API token in an environment variable, e.g. ENTITYCORE_TOKEN\\ntoken_manager = TokenFromEnv(env_var_name=\\ENTITYCORE_TOKEN\\\")\\n\\n# Replace with your project context values (example placeholders)\\nproject_context = ProjectContext(\\n    virtual_lab_id=\\a98b7abc-fc46-4700-9e3d-37137812c730\\\",\\n    project_id=\\0dbced5f-cc3d-488a-8c7f-cfb8ea039dc6\\\",\\n)\\n\\n# If using a custom API URL (e.g., local/dev), provide api_url; otherwise use defaults for environment\\nclient = Client(api_url=\\http://127.0.0.1:8000\\\", project_context=project_context, token_manager=token_manager)\\n\\n# -------------------------\\n# 1) List a limited number\\n# -------------------------\\n# Get a small preview (limit=10)\\niterator = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, limit=10)\\nmorphs_preview = iterator.all()   # returns a list of up to 'limit' entities\\n\\nprint(f\\Preview count: {len(morphs_preview)}\\\")\\nfor m in morphs_preview:\\n    print(f\\ID: {m.id}  Name: {m.name}\\\")\\n\\n# -------------------------\\n# 2) List ALL morphologies\\n# -------------------------\\n# Use limit=None to iterate over all results (the iterator handles pagination)\\nall_iterator = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, limit=None)\\n\\n# Convert to list (be mindful of memory if the dataset is very large)\\nall_morphs = all_iterator.all()\\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\\n\\n# Optionally iterate in streaming fashion to avoid holding all in memory:\\nfor morph in client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, limit=None):\\n    # process morph (e.g., print id)\\n    print(morph.id)\\n\\n# -------------------------\\n# 3) Filter by brain region label and species\\n# -------------------------\\n# Example: Primary motor cortex (label) and Mus musculus (species)\\nquery = {\\n    \\brain_location__brain_region__label\\\": \\Primary motor cortex\\\",\\n    \\subject__species__label\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"\\n}\\n\\nfiltered_iter = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, query=query, limit=None)\\nfiltered_list = filtered_iter.all()\\nprint(f\\Filtered count (PMC, mouse): {len(filtered_list)}\\\")\\nfor m in filtered_list[:10]:   # show first 10 matches\\n    print(f\\ID: {m.id}  Name: {m.name}\\\")\\n\\n# -------------------------\\n# 4) Example: filter by brain region UUID\\n# -------------------------\\n# If you have a brain region **UUID**: use the appropriate query field (see docs / API)\\n# Example placeholder:\\nbrain_region_uuid = \\PUT-BRAIN-REGION-UUID-HERE\\\"\\nquery_by_uuid = {\\within_brain_region_brain_region_id\\\": brain_region_uuid}\\niter_by_uuid = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, query=query_by_uuid, limit=None)\\nprint(\\Count by brain region UUID:\\\", len(iter_by_uuid.all()))\\n```\\n\\n## Notes and best practices\\n- Token management: use TokenFromEnv, TokenFromValue, or TokenFromFunction depending on how you want to supply tokens (examples in docs).\\n- Pagination: `client.search_entity(..., limit=None)` returns an iterator that transparently pages the API. Use `.all()` to collect into a list, or iterate directly to stream results and reduce memory use.\\n- Filtering: use keys like `brain_location__brain_region__label` and `subject__species__label` as shown in examples. For brain-region-based queries using the platform brain-region UUIDs, use parameters such as `within_brain_region_brain_region_id` (see EntityCore docs/examples).\\n- Large result sets: avoid `.all()` if the dataset is huge; iterate and process items one-by-one.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- adapt the snippet to your actual project context (you can provide the project UUIDs or environment),\\n- show an example that writes morphologies to disk (JSON/CSV),\\n- or demonstrate querying by mtype (e.g., `\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\L5_TPC:A\\\"`).",

This will compute connection probabilities and synapse counts between node sets and supports grouping by node properties.\\n\\nWould you like me to:\\n- Run connectivity analysis for a specific edge population (suggest: **S1nonbarrel_neurons__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical**) and optionally group by a property (e.g., **mtype** or **layer**)?\\n- Or retrieve a more detailed node/edge description (increase node/edge detail in the metrics call) so we can build precise selection filters (pre/post selections)?\\n\\nTell me which edge population and grouping or whether you want more detailed node/edge metadata, and I will proceed.",

Next, I'll retrieve the metrics for morphology ID c9ab5cef-e01f-4d60-bbbb-d3b103f4b950 using the morphometrics tool.Now that I have the per-section lengths, I'll compute basic summary statistics and generate a Plotly histogram (with a boxplot inset) to show the distribution of section_length for that morphology. I'll run a short Python script to produce the plot and print count, mean, median, std, min, and max.Because the Python run failed due to an environment error, I'll retry the plotting and statistics computation with the same data in a new Python execution to generate the Plotly histogram and boxplot.## Summary\\n\\n**Reasoning:** The morphometrics tool returned the full per-section lengths for morphology **c9ab5cef-e01f-4d60-bbbb-d3b103f4b950**, so the next step is to compute summary statistics and produce a Plotly histogram (with a small boxplot) from those values. I attempted to run a Plotly script in the execution environment, but the plotting call failed due to an environment installation error.\\n\\n### What I have\\n- **Morphology ID:** **c9ab5cef-e01f-4d60-bbbb-d3b103f4b950**\\n- The morphometrics tool returned the full list of **section_lengths** (a long array of numeric values).\\n\\n### Problem encountered\\n- The Python/Plotly execution failed with an environment error: \\Could not resolve 'npm:pyodide@0.29.3'\\\". Because of that, I was not able to render the Plotly figure in this session.\\n\\n## Options (choose one)\\n- Option A \\u2014 Retry plotting now: I can re-run the plotting step immediately (same data) and attempt to generate the histogram + boxplot again. This may succeed if the transient environment issue is resolved.\\n- Option B \\u2014 Export numeric distribution: I can compute and return numeric summary statistics (count, mean, median, std, min, max) and a numeric histogram (counts per bin) directly here without rendering a figure.\\n- Option C \\u2014 Provide the raw section_lengths array (the full list returned by morphometrics) so you can plot locally or in your preferred environment.\\n\\nPlease tell me which option you prefer (A, B, or C). If you choose A, I will retry generating the Plotly figure and include the visualization here once the environment allows it. If you choose B, I will compute and display the summary statistics and a histogram table immediately. If you choose C, I will paste the full section_lengths array for your download/use.\\n\\nIf you want me to proceed immediately, reply with the option letter; otherwise tell me any specific plotting preferences (bin count, log-scale, cumulative, units) and I will include them on the retry.",

    "expected_output": "## Single Cell Simulation Example (OBI-One)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step single-cell simulation example using the OBI-One Python API (openbraininstitute/obi-one). It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.

Next, I'll request the obi-one docs and ask specifically for examples on creating single-cell simulations.## Single-cell simulation with obi-one (obione) \\u2014 complete Python example\\n\\nBelow is a self-contained example that shows the typical steps to create, configure, validate, run, and retrieve results for a single-cell (ME-Model) simulation using the obi-one (obione) package.\\n\\nReasoning: use the MEModel-specific simulation form because single-cell simulations on morphology+electrical models in the platform are provided via MEModelSimulationScanConfig; after building and validating the configuration the BlueCelluLab backend (or another supported simulator) runs the simulation and produces outputs (optionally NWB).\\n\\n```python\\n# single_cell_simulation_example.py\\n# Requires: obi_one installed and configured (authentication / environment per your platform setup)\\n\\nimport pathlib\\nimport obi_one as obi  # obi-one package\\n\\n# 1) PARAMETERS / placeholders - replace these with your actual IDs / paths\\nmemodel_id = \\00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\\   # <- replace with a real ME-Model UUID from EntityCore\\nsimulation_length_ms = 2000.0\\ncurrent_amplitude_nA = 0.5\\noutput_dir = pathlib.Path(\\\"./obi_one_single_cell_out\\\")\\noutput_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\\n\\n# 2) Build an empty MEModel simulation scan configuration\\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\\n\\n# 3) Add metadata (Info block) - optional but recommended\\ninfo = obi.Info(\\n    campaign_name=\\Single-cell MEModel test\\\",\\n    campaign_description=\\Somatic current clamp on single MEModel; record soma voltage\\\"\\n)\\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\\n\\n# 4) Timestamps: a single stimulus at t=100 ms (example)\\ntimestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=100.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=simulation_length_ms)\\nsim_conf.add(timestamps, name=\\timestamps\\\")\\n\\n# 5) Stimulus: somatic constant current clamp\\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\\n    timestamps=timestamps.ref,   # reference to timestamps block\\n    duration=50.0,               # ms duration of the clamp\\n    amplitude=current_amplitude_nA\\n)\\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\current_clamp\\\")\\n\\n# 6) Recordings: record soma voltage for the simulated time window\\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=simulation_length_ms)\\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name=\\soma_voltage\\\")\\n\\n# 7) Initialization: specify the ME-Model to use and simulation-level parameters\\n# Use MEModelFromID to reference an existing MEModel in the EntityCore catalog\\ninitialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=memodel_id),\\n    simulation_length=simulation_length_ms,\\n    v_init=-80.0,         # initial membrane potential (mV)\\n    random_seed=42\\n)\\nsim_conf.set(initialize, name=\\initialize\\\")\\n\\n# 8) Validate the configuration (produces a validated_config object)\\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\\nprint(\\Validated simulation configuration created.\\\")\\n\\n# 9) Save validated configuration to file (optional)\\nvalidated_conf_path = output_dir / \\validated_me_model_simulation_config.json\\\"\\nwith open(validated_conf_path, \\w\\\") as f:\\n    f.write(validated_sim_conf.json(indent=2))   # validated_sim_conf implements .json()\\nprint(f\\Saved validated configuration to: {validated_conf_path}\\\")\\n\\n# 10) Run the simulation using the obi-one orchestrator (BlueCelluLab backend shown)\\n# Note: the run() function path may vary by obi-one version; examples show:\\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\\n\\n# Run - supply the saved config path or the validated object depending on your obi-one version.\\n# Set simulator='bluecellulab' to use the BlueCelluLab backend that obi-one supports.\\nrun(\\n    simulation_config=str(validated_conf_path),\\n    simulator='bluecellulab',   # or another supported simulator name if available\\n    save_nwb=True,              # whether to request NWB output\\n    output_dir=str(output_dir)  # where to store results\\n)\\n\\nprint(\\Simulation run requested. Check the output directory for results (NWB, logs, etc.).\\\")\\n\\n# 11) Retrieve and inspect outputs (example: list files in the output directory)\\nfor p in output_dir.iterdir():\\n    print(p)\\n```\\n\\n### Notes and practical tips\\n- **Replace** memodel_id with a real ME-Model UUID available in your EntityCore account. You can list ME-Models via the platform API (EntityCore) and pick an appropriate one.\\n- The example uses **MEModelSimulationScanConfig**, which is intended for single neuron (morphology + electrical) simulations. For circuit-level simulations use CircuitSimulationScanConfig instead.\\n- The call to run(...) in obi-one typically accepts either a path to a validated configuration file or a validated configuration object, depending on package version. The example saves the validated JSON and calls run with that path for compatibility.\\n- The simulator backend (here 'bluecellulab') must be accessible from your environment and properly configured.\\n- set **save_nwb=True** to get NWB-formatted output; check obi-one / platform docs for where output files are deposited and how the run function returns status.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- (a) show how to find available ME-Model IDs programmatically using the EntityCore API,\\n- (b) adapt the example to use a CircuitSimulationScanConfig instead,\\n- or (c) show how to parse the resulting NWB file (if produced) to extract soma voltage traces.
