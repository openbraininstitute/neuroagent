    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

use `.all()` to collect all results (or iterate lazily).\\n\\n### 1) Minimal example \\u2014 list all cell morphologies\\n\\n```python\\n# Example: list all cell morphologies (no filters)\\nimport os\\nfrom entitysdk.client import Client\\nfrom entitysdk.common import ProjectContext\\nfrom entitysdk.models import CellMorphology\\nfrom entitysdk.token_manager import TokenFromEnv\\n\\n# 1) Configure project context and token manager\\nproject_context = ProjectContext(\\n    virtual_lab_id=\\a98b7abc-fc46-4700-9e3d-37137812c730\\\",\\n    project_id=\\0dbced5f-cc3d-488a-8c7f-cfb8ea039dc6\\\",\\n)\\n\\n# Get token from environment variable ENTITYCORE_TOKEN\\ntoken_manager = TokenFromEnv(env_var_name=\\ENTITYCORE_TOKEN\\\")\\n\\n# 2) Initialize client (replace api_url if needed)\\nclient = Client(api_url=\\https://api.openbrainplatform.org\\\", project_context=project_context, token_manager=token_manager)\\n\\n# 3) Search for all CellMorphology entities\\n# Use limit=None to request all results via the SDK (it handles pagination)\\nmorph_iter = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, query=None, limit=None)\\n\\n# 4) Iterate and print metadata\\nfor m in morph_iter:\\n    morphology_id = getattr(m, \\id\\\", None)\\n    name = getattr(m, \\name\\\", None)\\n    # Subject/species and brain region fields may be nested; use getattr or dict access accordingly\\n    species = getattr(getattr(m, \\subject\\\", None), \\species\\\", None)\\n    species_label = getattr(species, \\label\\\", None) if species else None\\n    # brain_location -> brain_region -> label (if present)\\n    brain_loc = getattr(m, \\brain_location\\\", None)\\n    brain_region = getattr(brain_loc, \\brain_region\\\", None) if brain_loc else None\\n    brain_region_label = getattr(brain_region, \\label\\\", None) if brain_region else None\\n\\n    print(f\\ID: {morphology_id} | Name: {name} | Species: {species_label} | Brain region: {brain_region_label}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n### 2) Example with explicit filtering by brain region (by region ID or label)\\n\\n- To filter by brain region ID, use a query like `{\\brain_location__brain_region__id\\\": \\\"<REGION_UUID>\\}`.\\n- To filter by brain region label, use `{\\brain_location__brain_region__label\\\": \\Primary motor cortex\\}`.\\n- The exact query keys follow the EntitySDK examples in the docs (see `brain_location__brain_region__label` usage).\\n\\n```python\\n# Example: filter morphologies by brain region (by ID)\\nregion_id = \\2a156e47-0842-4a40-bd1e-2afffb4dbafd\\  # replace with target region UUID\\n\\nquery = {\\n    \\brain_location__brain_region__id\\\": region_id\\n}\\n\\nmorph_iter = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, query=query, limit=None)\\n\\nfor m in morph_iter:\\n    print(f\\ID: {m.id} | Name: {m.name}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n### 3) Handling large result sets / pagination explicitly (if you prefer manual pages)\\n\\nThe SDK supports `page` and `page_size` in the query \\u2014 useful if you want to pull pages manually instead of using `limit=None`.\\n\\n```python\\npage = 1\\npage_size = 100\\nwhile True:\\n    query = {\\page\\\": page, \\page_size\\\": page_size}\\n    hits = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, query=query, limit=None).all()\\n    if not hits:\\n        break\\n    for m in hits:\\n        print(f\\\"{m.id} {m.name}\\\")\\n    page += 1\\n```\\n\\n### 4) Authentication options (examples from docs)\\n\\n- From environment variable (recommended for scripts / CI):\\n\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk.token_manager import TokenFromEnv\\ntoken_manager = TokenFromEnv(env_var_name=\\ENTITYCORE_TOKEN\\\")\\nclient = Client(api_url=..., project_context=..., token_manager=token_manager)\\n```\\n\\n- From direct token value:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk.token_manager import TokenFromValue\\ntoken_manager = TokenFromValue(value=\\your-jwt-token-here\\\")\\nclient = Client(..., token_manager=token_manager)\\n```\\n\\n- From a function that returns tokens:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk.token_manager import TokenFromFunction\\ndef get_token():\\n    # fetch/refresh token logic\\n    return \\jwt-token\\\"\\ntoken_manager = TokenFromFunction(func=get_token)\\n```\\n\\n### 5) Field availability note\\nDifferent morphology entities may have different nested structures for subject/species and brain location. The safe approach is to use getattr checks (as in the examples) so your script won't crash when a field is missing.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Provide a complete runnable script tailored to your environment (you can give api_url, project IDs, and preferred auth method), or\\n- Show how to save the results to CSV/JSON, or\\n- Demonstrate retrieving additional fields (measurements, mtypes, assets).",

    "expected_output": "## Single Cell Simulation Example (OBI-One)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step single-cell simulation example using the OBI-One Python API (openbraininstitute/obi-one). It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.
