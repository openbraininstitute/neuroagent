    "ai_response": "## Overview \\u2014 How to run simulations on the Open Brain Platform\\n\\nBelow I give a step\\u2011by\\u2011step, actionable guide to create, configure and run simulations on the Open Brain Platform, plus tips for common simulation types (single neuron, me\\u2011model, synaptome / circuit). I\\u2019ll assume you want to run simulations available on the platform (not a custom local-only pipeline). If you want me to generate a simulation configuration JSON for a specific circuit, I will call the platform generation tool for you (see last section).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1) Decide the simulation scale and goal\\n- **Single neuron** \\u2014 explore electrophysiology on a single me\\u2011model (morphology + e\\u2011model). Use when testing intrinsic properties, current injections, or validating e\\u2011models.\\n- **Small / microcircuit** \\u2014 simulate a few connected neurons to study motif dynamics or short circuits.\\n- **Region / system / whole brain** \\u2014 atlas\\u2011driven large circuits using neuron densities, synaptome & connectivity; for large\\u2011scale emergent dynamics or hypothesis testing.\\n- **Analysis goals** \\u2014 what outputs do you need? membrane traces, spike rasters, LFP, synaptic weights, metabolic outputs, or other state variables.\\n\\nWrite down: scale, species/brain region, model IDs (if known), stimulation protocol, outputs and runtime.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2) Explore available assets and pick models (Atlas-driven)\\n- Use the platform UI or APIs to locate:\\n  - **Me\\u2011models** (morphology + electrical) and **e\\u2011models** (electrical models)\\n  - **Morphologies**, **ion channels**, **synaptome** or microcircuit circuits\\n  - Prebuilt **simulations** and **notebooks**\\n- Important metadata to note: **species**, **brain region**, **mtype/etype**, and **validation status** of me-/e\\u2011models.\\n\\nTip: start with a validated me\\u2011model for your brain region and species to reduce debugging.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3) Create or choose a circuit (circuit_id required)\\n- Each simulation configuration must reference a circuit. Circuits may already exist on the platform (single neuron, microcircuit, region).\\n- If you don\\u2019t have a circuit, create one by assembling:\\n  - neuron populations (me\\u2011models or model templates)\\n  - connectivity (intrinsic and extrinsic)\\n  - stimulation sources (current injections, synaptic drives, pattern inputs)\\n  - output probes (voltage, spikes, extracellular)\\n- Keep a note of the circuit UUID \\u2014 it is required to generate/run simulation configs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4) Build the simulation configuration (JSON)\\n- The platform uses structured JSON simulation configs. A complete config includes:\\n  - **circuit_id** (UUID)\\n  - runtime parameters (dt, tstop, seed)\\n  - stimulation protocols (amplitude, onset, duration, target populations)\\n  - recording probes and saved outputs\\n  - solver / backend preferences (single\\u2011node, distributed, level of biological detail)\\n- Do not send incremental edits \\u2014 the config request must describe the final desired state.\\n\\nIf you want, I can generate that JSON for you from a plain-English description (requires the circuit UUID). I will produce a ready\\u2011to\\u2011submit config using the platform generator.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5) Run the simulation\\n- Submit the JSON config through the platform UI or via the simulations API.\\n- Monitor status: queued \\u2192 running \\u2192 success/failure.\\n- For long or large simulations, choose appropriate compute resources and checkpointing options.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6) Retrieve and analyze outputs\\n- Download raw outputs (timeseries, spike lists, metadata).\\n- Use platform notebooks or your own analysis tools (Jupyter) to visualize:\\n  - voltage traces, spike rasters, firing rates, synaptic currents, connectivity changes, LFPs, etc.\\n- For reproducibility, keep: config JSON, circuit_id, random seeds, and software versions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7) Common practical tips and pitfalls\\n- Start small: validate with short runtime and single neuron/current step before scaling up.\\n- Use validated me\\u2011models and proven e\\u2011models where possible to avoid non\\u2011biological behavior.\\n- Save configuration and metadata alongside outputs for reproducibility.\\n- Check units (ms, mV, nA) and coordinate systems when using atlas\\u2011based circuits.\\n- For region/system simulations, watch memory and runtime \\u2014 downsample outputs or use aggregated probes if needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## If you want me to generate a simulation config for you\\nI can generate the exact JSON config the platform needs. I will use the platform generation tool and produce a full configuration. To proceed I need:\\n- The target **circuit UUID** (required). If you don\\u2019t have one, tell me the circuit name and the brain region \\u2014 I can help find candidates first.\\n- A clear final description of the desired simulation (include scale, tstop, dt, stimuli, probes, seed, and any solver/backend preferences).\\n\\nExample short request you can paste:\\n- \\Simulate circuit <circuit_id> for 1 second (tstop=1000 ms, dt=0.025 ms), inject 300 pA DC from 100\\u2013600 ms into population A (me_model id X), record soma voltage and spikes from population A and B, random seed 42.\\\"\\n\\nIf you provide that, I will call the generator and return the ready\\u2011to\\u2011submit JSON.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSummary\\n- Decide scale and goals \\u2192 pick circuit and models \\u2192 produce a complete JSON config (circuit_id required) \\u2192 submit/run \\u2192 retrieve and analyze outputs.\\n- I can prepare the full simulation JSON for you now \\u2014 provide the circuit UUID and the simulation details you want.",
