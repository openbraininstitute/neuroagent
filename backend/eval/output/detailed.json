    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

Setting `limit=None` returns an iterator for all pages (the SDK handles pagination).\\n\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\n# Get an iterator over all CellMorphology entities\\niterator = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, query={}, limit=None)\\n\\n# Iterate and print ID and Name\\nfor morph in iterator:\\n    print(f\\ID: {morph.id}  |  Name: {morph.name}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNotes:\\n- `limit=None` makes the iterator fetch across pages automatically.\\n- Each `morph` is an instance of the SDK model (has attributes like `id`, `name`, `description`, etc.).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3) Paginated fetch with explicit page_size\\nIf you prefer manual pagination control:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\npage = 1\\npage_size = 50\\nwhile True:\\n    query = {\\page\\\": page, \\page_size\\\": page_size}\\n    results = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, query=query, limit=None).all()\\n    if not results:\\n        break\\n    for morph in results:\\n        print(f\\ID: {morph.id}  |  Name: {morph.name}\\\")\\n    page += 1\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4) Filter by brain region (example: use brain region UUID or annotation value)\\nYou can filter by brain region fields. Two common approaches:\\n\\n- By brain region UUID (if you know it)\\n- By brain region annotation value (e.g., an integer)\\n\\nExample: filter by annotation value = 477\\n\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\nquery = {\\n    \\brain_region__annotation_value\\\": 477,  # filter by annotation value\\n    \\page\\\": 1,\\n    \\page_size\\\": 100\\n}\\niterator = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, query=query, limit=None)\\n\\nfor morph in iterator:\\n    print(f\\ID: {morph.id}  |  Name: {morph.name}  |  Brain region label: {getattr(morph.brain_region, 'label', None)}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nIf you have a brain region UUID:\\n```python\\nquery = {\\brain_region__id\\\": \\2a156e47-0842-4a40-bd1e-2afffb4dbafd\\\"}\\niterator = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, query=query, limit=None)\\nfor morph in iterator:\\n    print(f\\ID: {morph.id}  |  Name: {morph.name}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5) Useful filters and fields\\n- name__ilike: case-insensitive wildcard name search (e.g., `\\name__ilike\\\": \\L5_*\\`)\\n- mtype__pref_label: filter by morphological type label (e.g., `\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\L5_TPC:A\\`)\\n- subject__species__label or subject__species__name: filter by species\\n- brain_region__annotation_value or brain_region__id: filter by region\\n\\nExample combining filters:\\n```python\\nquery = {\\n    \\name__ilike\\\": \\my-morph*\\\",\\n    \\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\L5_TPC:A\\\",\\n    \\subject__species__label\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"\\n}\\niterator = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, query=query, limit=None)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6) Handling results and attributes\\n- Each returned morphology object exposes attributes like **id**, **name**, **description**, **brain_region**, **mtype**, **measurements**, etc.\\n- For nested fields, use getattr or check for None before accessing (e.g., `getattr(morph.brain_region, \\label\\\", None)`).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Summary\\n- Initialize the `Client` with API URL, project context and token.\\n- Use `client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, query=..., limit=None)` to get an iterator for all matching morphologies; this handles pagination for you.\\n- Apply filters via the `query` dict (brain region, mtype, name__ilike, etc.) to narrow results.\\n- Print `morph.id` and `morph.name` for each entry.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Provide a turnkey script that writes results to CSV with selected fields (ID, name, species, brain region).\\n- Show an example that fetches full morphology details via `client.get_entity` / `client.search_entity(...).one()` for a single morphology ID.

If you have a Pro monthly/yearly subscription that provides free credits, subtract the free credits first before buying extra credits.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Important notes and limitations\\n- All figures above come directly from the platform documents returned by the system; no external sources were used.\\n- Education and Enterprise plans are contact-based: they can include custom compute/credit bundles and different pricing \\u2014 contact your account manager for firm quotes.\\n- The platform may apply different per-credit pricing for internal billing, taxes, or promotions \\u2014 use these numbers as the canonical catalog prices from the platform docs.\\n\\nGiven this, the next useful step is to estimate the exact CHF cost for the simulation you intend to run (I can compute it from the simulation type, number of neurons, and biological time). If you want that, tell me:\\n- Which plan you have (Free / Pro / Education / Enterprise), and\\n- Simulation type (single-cell, small microcircuit with N neurons, or microcircuit with N neurons), and\\n- Biological simulation duration in seconds (for microcircuits), and\\n- Whether you want to use free credits from a subscription first or buy credits directly.",

The page is constrained to show only morphologies that live within (or were assigned to) the brain region represented by the UUID 2a156e47-0842-4a40-bd1e-2afffb4dbafd. The numeric annotation value shown (477) is the atlas annotation corresponding to that region.\n\nNext steps I can take for you\nResolve the brain region UUID to its human-readable name and show the first page of matching cell-morphology entries (includes count, and a list of items with key metadata).\nShow details for a specific morphology if you click/select one (or tell me which ID/name you want).\nDownload a morphology asset or list available assets for an entry.\nTell me which of these you want me to do and I\u2019ll proceed.

    "expected_output": "## Single Cell Simulation Example (OBI-One)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step single-cell simulation example using the OBI-One Python API (openbraininstitute/obi-one). It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.
