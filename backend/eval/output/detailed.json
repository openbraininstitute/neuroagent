    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

Add them to `params` as needed.\\n- The exact JSON field names returned by your deployment can vary. Inspect one page (print `resp.json()`) to confirm whether the endpoint uses `results`, `items`, `count`, or `total_items`.\\n- Respect rate limits; use a reasonable `page_size` and consider backoff on 429 responses.\\n- Keep API tokens secure. For scripts, prefer reading from environment variables (os.environ) or a secrets manager.\\n\\n### Example: using environment variable for token\\n```python\\nimport os\\nAPI_TOKEN = os.environ.get(\\OB_PLATFORM_TOKEN\\\")\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Provide a ready-to-run example tailored to the exact JSON structure of your platform (if you paste one sample response), or\\n- Show how to call this with specific filters (species, brain region), or\\n- Provide an example using an official Python SDK method if you tell me the exact SDK class/method names you have (e.g., entitysdk.EntityCore.cell_morphology.get_all).",

It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.

Treat this as a clear, idiomatic example \\u2014 adapt field names and function calls to the exact obione version in your environment or ask me to fetch the current documentation.\\n\\n### Example: run a single-cell simulation and plot Vm\\n\\n```python\\n# Example: single_cell_simulation.py\\n# Requires: obione, numpy, matplotlib (or plotly)\\n# Install (if available): pip install obione numpy matplotlib\\n\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom obione import ObioneClient        # replace with actual import path if different\\nfrom obione.models import (\\n    SingleCellSimulationConfig,       # high-level config dataclass / builder\\n    StimulusCurrentStep,\\n    RecordingConfig,\\n    MorphologyRef,\\n    EModelRef,\\n)\\n\\n# 1) Create API client (authenticate as required)\\nclient = ObioneClient(api_token=\\YOUR_API_TOKEN\\\")  # or other auth method\\n\\n# 2) Build single-cell simulation configuration\\nsim_config = SingleCellSimulationConfig(\\n    name=\\SingleCell: step current test\\\",\\n    description=\\Inject a 200 pA step current to soma, record soma Vm\\\",\\n    # reference existing morphology and e-model by ID or name\\n    morphology=MorphologyRef(id=\\morph-uuid-or-name\\\"),\\n    emodel=EModelRef(id=\\emodel-uuid-or-name\\\"),\\n    initialize={\\n        \\v_init\\\": -70.0,              # initial membrane potential (mV)\\n        \\extracellular_calcium_concentration\\\": 1.2,  # mM (example)\\n        \\random_seed\\\": 1234\\n    },\\n    simulation_length_ms=500.0,       # total simulation length (ms)\\n    dt_ms=0.025                       # simulation timestep (ms)\\n)\\n\\n# 3) Define stimuli (current clamp)\\nstep_stim = StimulusCurrentStep(\\n    target_location=\\soma\\\",          # e.g., \\soma\\ or node-set name; adapt to API\\n    start_time_ms=100.0,\\n    duration_ms=200.0,\\n    amplitude_pA=200.0               # picoamps\\n)\\n\\nsim_config.stimuli = [step_stim]\\n\\n# 4) Define recordings\\nrec_soma = RecordingConfig(\\n    record_target=\\soma\\\",            # e.g., soma compartment or node-set\\n    variables=[\\v\\\"],                 # membrane potential\\n    sample_interval_ms=0.1\\n)\\nsim_config.recordings = [rec_soma]\\n\\n# 5) Create the simulation on the platform (register/configure)\\nsimulation = client.single_cell.create_simulation(sim_config)\\n# simulation will contain an id and the resolved simulation resource\\n\\n# 6) Run the simulation (synchronously or async)\\n# Synchronous run (blocks until finished)\\nresult = client.single_cell.run_simulation(simulation.id, wait=True)\\n\\n# 7) Retrieve recorded traces (the API might return as arrays or as downloadable files)\\n# Example: result.recordings is a dict with arrays\\nt = result.recordings[\\soma\\\"][\\time_ms\\\"]      # time vector (ms)\\nvm = result.recordings[\\soma\\\"][\\v\\\"]            # membrane potential (mV)\\n\\n# 8) Simple plot (matplotlib)\\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,3.5))\\nplt.plot(t, vm, color=\\C0\\\")\\nplt.xlabel(\\Time (ms)\\\")\\nplt.ylabel(\\Vm (mV)\\\")\\nplt.title(\\Single-cell Vm: step current injection (200 pA)\\\")\\nplt.axvspan(100, 300, color=\\orange\\\", alpha=0.15, label=\\stimulus\\\")\\nplt.legend()\\nplt.tight_layout()\\nplt.show()\\n\\n# 9) Optional: save results locally\\nnp.savez(\\single_cell_step_result.npz\\\", time_ms=t, vm=vm)\\n```\\n\\n### Explanations / mapping\\n- Authenticate with your obione credentials or token when creating the client.\\n- Morphology and EModel references typically point to existing platform entities (use UUIDs or human-readable names depending on the API).\\n- Initialization parameters: v_init, extracellular calcium, random seed \\u2014 set physiological defaults as needed.\\n- Stimuli: current-clamp (step) is illustrated. You can add other stimulus types (noisy current, synaptic conductance) if supported.\\n- Recordings: choose what variables (v, ionic currents, spikes) and sampling interval.\\n- Running: some deployments support asynchronous runs with an execution id and polling; others allow blocking runs that return results directly.\\n- Results: API may return traces in-memory or provide downloadable files (SONATA, HDF5, JSON). Adapt retrieval code accordingly.\\n\\n### Next steps I can help with\\n- Fetch the exact obione API reference for your installed version so we can adapt the code to precise class/method names.\\n- Provide an example that records multiple compartments, or uses synaptic stimuli.\\n- Convert plotting to Plotly for interactive figures (I can run code and display a Plotly figure if you want).\\n\\nWould you like me to fetch the current obione single-cell documentation pages or generate runnable code that uses the platform REST endpoints for your account?",
