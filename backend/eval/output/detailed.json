    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

With that documentation I can provide a ready-to-run Python example using the SDK.## Overview\\n\\nFirst create an authenticated EntitySDK client and project context. Next run a typed search for **CellMorphology** entities, choose whether to iterate results (stream) or fetch pages (.all()), and apply filters such as brain region or species. Below are concise, ready-to-run examples and notes.\\n\\n### Quick plan\\n- Create the **Client** with a project context and token.  \\n- Search for **CellMorphology** using `client.search_entity(...)`.  \\n- Handle pagination either by iterating the returned iterator or using `.all()` to fetch all hits.  \\n- Apply filters (brain region, species) via the `query` dictionary and access fields (`id`, `name`, `brain_region`, `subject.species.name`).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Example: Minimal setup and listing morphologies\\n\\n```python\\nimport os\\nfrom uuid import UUID\\nfrom entitysdk.client import Client\\nfrom entitysdk.common import ProjectContext\\nfrom entitysdk.models import CellMorphology\\n\\n# Authentication + project context (replace with your values or env vars)\\nAPI_URL = os.getenv(\\ENTITYCORE_API_URL\\\", \\https://entitycore.openbraininstitute.org\\\")\\nPROJECT_ID = UUID(os.getenv(\\PROJECT_ID\\\", \\00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\\\"))\\nVIRTUAL_LAB_ID = UUID(os.getenv(\\VIRTUAL_LAB_ID\\\", \\00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\\\"))\\nTOKEN = os.getenv(\\ACCESS_TOKEN\\\", \\your-access-token\\\")\\n\\nproject_context = ProjectContext(project_id=PROJECT_ID, virtual_lab_id=VIRTUAL_LAB_ID)\\nclient = Client(api_url=API_URL, project_context=project_context, token_manager=TOKEN)\\n```\\n\\nNotes:\\n- Use the correct API URL and valid UUIDs for your project and virtual lab.\\n- The token can be taken from environment variables or other token manager used by your deployment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Example A \\u2014 Stream results (memory efficient)\\n\\nThis uses the iterator returned by `client.search_entity(...)`. It\\u2019s suitable when the result set may be large.\\n\\n```python\\niterator = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\\n    query={},   # optional filters go here\\n    limit=None  # None means no hard limit; iterate until exhausted\\n)\\n\\nfor morph in iterator:\\n    print(\\ID:\\\", morph.id)\\n    print(\\Name:\\\", morph.name)\\n    # Access nested fields if present\\n    print(\\Brain region:\\\", getattr(morph, \\brain_region\\\", None))\\n    # subject may be nested; guard for missing attributes:\\n    subject = getattr(morph, \\subject\\\", None)\\n    species_name = None\\n    if subject is not None:\\n        species_name = getattr(getattr(subject, \\species\\\", None), \\name\\\", None)\\n    print(\\Subject species:\\\", species_name)\\n    print(\\\"---\\\")\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Example B \\u2014 Fetch all results (convenient, but potentially memory-heavy)\\n\\nUse `.all()` when you expect a moderate number of results and want them available as a list.\\n\\n```python\\nhits = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\\n    query={},       # filters (see next section)\\n    limit=None\\n).all()\\n\\nprint(\\Total hits:\\\", len(hits))\\nfor morph in hits:\\n    print(morph.id, morph.name)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Filtering examples\\n\\nUse the `query` dictionary to pass API filters. Common keys (from SDK examples):\\n\\n- Case-insensitive name match:\\n  - `\\name__ilike\\\": \\pyramidal%\\\"`\\n- Filter by brain region label (path used in examples):\\n  - `\\brain_location__brain_region__label\\\": \\Primary motor cortex\\\"`\\n- Filter by species label:\\n  - `\\subject__species__label\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"`\\n- Pagination parameters (if you prefer page-by-page):\\n  - `\\page\\\": 1`, `\\page_size\\\": 50`\\n\\nExample: filter by brain region and species:\\n\\n```python\\nquery = {\\n    \\brain_location__brain_region__label\\\": \\Primary motor cortex\\\",\\n    \\subject__species__label\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\",\\n    \\page\\\": 1,\\n    \\page_size\\\": 50\\n}\\n\\niterator = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, query=query, limit=None)\\nfor morph in iterator:\\n    print(morph.id, morph.name)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Accessing returned fields reliably\\n\\nBecause some fields may be absent, use defensive attribute access:\\n\\n- `morph.id` \\u2014 unique identifier (UUID string)\\n- `morph.name` \\u2014 morphology name\\n- `morph.description` \\u2014 optional\\n- `morph.brain_region` or nested `morph.brain_location.brain_region` \\u2014 depending on schema returned; inspect the object structure\\n- `morph.subject.species.name` \\u2014 species (guard for None at each level)\\n\\nPattern to read nested fields safely:\\n\\n```python\\ndef get_nested(obj, *attrs):\\n    cur = obj\\n    for a in attrs:\\n        if cur is None:\\n            return None\\n        cur = getattr(cur, a, None)\\n    return cur\\n\\nspecies_name = get_nested(morph, \\subject\\\", \\species\\\", \\name\\\")\\nbrain_region_label = get_nested(morph, \\brain_location\\\", \\brain_region\\\", \\label\\\")\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Pagination notes and total count\\n\\n- The iterator approach streams results and avoids manual paging.  \\n- The `.all()` convenience will fetch all results (respect `page`/`page_size` behind the scenes).  \\n- If you need to know `total_items` or to control pages explicitly, include `page` and `page_size` in `query` and inspect returned page metadata if the SDK exposes it (SDK examples show using `page` + `page_size` in `query`).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Helpful tips\\n\\n- Start with small `page_size` during development to inspect returned object fields and decide which nested keys exist in your environment.\\n- Use `.all()` only when result counts are moderate to avoid memory issues.\\n- Example query keys shown above are taken from EntitySDK examples \\u2014 if your instance exposes slightly different field names, inspect one result to confirm paths.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you'd like, I can:\\n- Provide a concrete example tailored to a specific brain region or species you care about, or  \\n- Show a short snippet that prints the complete JSON/dict for the first result so you can inspect available fields and nested structure.",

That means costs scale with both neuron count and simulated biological time.\\n- Some features (notebooks, EM skeletonization, builds) also consume credits; include those if your workflow uses them.\\n- Pro subscriptions include monthly/annual free credits which reduce incremental simulation costs.\\n- The Free plan\\u2019s **100 initial credits** can cover many small simulations; check expiry (1 year) and non-transferability.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Estimate the credits (and approximate CHF if on Pro) for a specific simulation scenario \\u2014 tell me: circuit size (neurons), expected biological simulation time, and whether you\\u2019re on Free or Pro.\\n- Retrieve the Education or Enterprise plan document pages in full for exact contact or included compute-credit details.",

    "expected_output": "## Single Cell Simulation Example (OBI-One)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step single-cell simulation example using the OBI-One Python API (openbraininstitute/obi-one). It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.
