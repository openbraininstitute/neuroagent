This suggests layer-2-targeting excitatory cells receive little inhibition from LBC, while L3 excitatory targets receive dense LBC synapses.\\n- **L23_NBC is heterogeneous by target**: low probability (16.67%) but large mean synapse count (33.0) onto L2_TPC:B \\u2014 indicating rare but strong (many-synapse) contacts when present \\u2014 whereas it connects to L3_TPC:A at 100% probability with even larger mean synapse count (36.0).\\n\\n## Limitations & notes\\n\\n- Data shown are only for the chemical edge population **S1nonbarrel_neurons__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical** (internal inhibitory\\u2192excitatory within the S1nonbarrel population).\\n- The grouping was by presynaptic **mtype** (as requested). The tool output presented only the combinations shown above; no other mtypes were returned in this grouped query.\\n- All numeric values are those returned by the connectivity metrics tool.\\n\\n## Suggested next steps\\n\\n- If you want, I can:\\n  - Expand grouping to include postsynaptic mtype as the primary grouping (i.e., show incoming inhibitory mtype composition per excitatory mtype).\\n  - Group by additional properties (e.g., layer, synapse_class) or provide per-mtype counts and variances.\\n  - Restrict the analysis to a specific layer (use string layer values like \\2\\\", \\3\\\", etc.) or to specific mtypes (using pre_selection/post_selection filters).\\n\\nWhich of these would you like to run next?",

    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

It shows authentication, a simple search to list morphologies, how to page through results (if desired), and a short preview of returned items.\\n\\n### Reasoning / next step\\nBecause listing entities can return many items, the example first performs a limited query to preview results and then shows how to retrieve all results safely (using the client helper .all()). This approach avoids unexpectedly large single requests while still allowing a full export when needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Example code\\n\\n```python\\n# Example: list CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain entitysdk\\n# Replace AUTH_TOKEN and API_URL with your credentials / endpoint.\\n\\nfrom entitysdk.client import Client\\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\\n\\n# 1) Create client (authenticate)\\nclient = Client(\\n    base_url=\\https://api.openbrain.cloud\\\",   # replace with your API URL if different\\n    token=\\YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE\\               # replace with your token\\n)\\n\\n# 2) Simple limited search (preview)\\n# Retrieves up to 10 morphologies to inspect results quickly.\\nmorphs_preview = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\\nprint(f\\Preview count: {len(morphs_preview)}\\\")\\nfor m in morphs_preview:\\n    print(m.id, m.name)\\n\\n# 3) Retrieve all morphologies (be mindful of size)\\n# The .all() helper will page through results for you.\\nall_morphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\\n\\n# 4) Example: iterate and show selected fields\\nfor m in all_morphs:\\n    # Typical properties available: id, name, description, brain_region, subject, created_date, ...\\n    print(f\\\"{m.id} | {m.name} | brain_region={getattr(m, 'brain_region', None)}\\\")\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Notes and tips\\n- **Preview first:** Use `limit=10` (or another small number) to preview results before retrieving everything.\\n- **Filters:** You can filter by query fields. Example from the docs:\\n  - Find morphologies by MType pref label:\\n    ```python\\n    morphs = client.search_entity(\\n        entity_type=CellMorphology, query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\\n    ).all()\\n    ```\\n- **Pagination:** The client `.all()` helper handles paging for you. If you prefer manual control, the SDK also supports pagination parameters.\\n- **Assets & uploads:** The SDK supports uploading morphology files (HDF5, SWC) to a registered CellMorphology entity using `upload_file` or `upload_content`.\\n- **Creating/registering:** To register a new morphology, construct a `CellMorphology` object (providing protocol, subject, brain_region, etc.) and call `client.register_entity(...)`.\\n- **Inspect models:** Objects returned are entity classes (have attributes like `id`, `name`, `brain_region`, etc.). Use `dir(m)` or `m.__dict__` to inspect available fields.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Show a full example that filters by species, brain region, or MType.\\n- Demonstrate how to download associated morphology assets for each entity.\\n- Provide a paginated iterator example that prints progress while retrieving thousands of items.",

If you want per-population property tables (e.g., property_names, property_unique_values, property_value_counts) or detailed edge statistics, we can:\\n  - Run a deeper metrics request with higher node/edge detail (increase level_of_detail_nodes and/or level_of_detail_edges), or\\n  - Use the connectivity metrics tool to compute connection probabilities and mean synapses for a chosen edge population and specific pre/post node sets or property filters.\\n\\nGiven that we now have the edge population names and nodeset names, the next logical action is to compute connectivity metrics for whichever connection you care about (for example: local S1->S1 chemical connectivity grouped by mtype or layer, or thalamus VPM->S1). Tell me which edge population and how you'd like to filter/group (e.g., pre_node_set = \\Excitatory\\\", post_node_set = \\Layer4\\\", group_by = \\mtype\\\"), and I will run the connectivity analysis.",

    "expected_output": "## Single Cell Simulation Example (OBI-One)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step single-cell simulation example using the OBI-One Python API (openbraininstitute/obi-one). It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.

For platform-backed execution / provenance, integrate with `entitysdk` and the platform submission APIs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## If you want the JSON simulation config for a specific circuit\\nProvide the **circuit_id** (UUID) you want to target and any final parameter choices (amplitude, duration, neuron id or node_set). Given that, I will create a complete simulation JSON configuration (suitable for platform submission) using the simulation-config generator and return it to you.",
