I successfully retrieved circuit structure and available node/edge populations, but the connectivity metrics endpoint returned a Not Found error when requested. As a result, I could not produce the requested grouped connectivity statistics.\\n\\nBelow are the details of what I did and the results returned by the platform.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1) Circuit structure (retrieved successfully)\\n- Circuit ID: **2eb602ea-9ffc-42a2-9fb7-5234921343d0**\\n- Biophysical node populations (count): **1**\\n  - Names: **S1nonbarrel_neurons**\\n- Virtual node populations (count): **3**\\n  - Names: **POm**, **VPM**, **external_S1nonbarrel_neurons**\\n- Available node sets (selected highlights):\\n  - **Excitatory**, **Inhibitory**, **All**\\n  - Many cell-type / layer / mtype node sets (e.g., **L23_BP**, **L4_TPC**, **L5_TPC:A**, **L1_NGC-DA**, etc.)\\n  - Several pre-built aggregate node sets (e.g., **Layer1Inhibitory**, **Layer23Inhibitory**, **Layer4Excitatory**, etc.)\\n- Chemical edge populations (count): **4**\\n  - **S1nonbarrel_neurons__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical**\\n  - **POm__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical**\\n  - **VPM__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical**\\n  - **external_S1nonbarrel_neurons__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical**\\n- Electrical edge populations: **0**\\n\\nNote: I used level_of_detail_nodes=1 to obtain available edge populations, node sets and property names for filtering.\\n\\nLinks to the retrieved entities (from the tool output) are available in the platform results (the tool output contains URL fields \\u2014 let me know if you want those included in this report).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2) Connectivity metrics request(s) (failed)\\nI then attempted to compute inhibitory \\u2192 excitatory connectivity grouped by **mtype** using the chemical edge population that links the neuron population to itself:\\n\\n- Edge population used: **S1nonbarrel_neurons__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical**\\n- Pre node set: **Inhibitory**\\n- Post node set: **Excitatory**\\n- Group by: **mtype**\\n\\nThe platform returned:\\n- Error: {\\detail\\\":\\Not Found\\\"}\\n\\nI retried a similar query (pre=Inhibitory, post=All) and received the same Not Found error.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3) Interpretation and likely causes\\nThe \\Not Found\\ error from the connectivity metrics endpoint can indicate a few possible issues on the platform side:\\n- The connectivity metrics service endpoint for this circuit or for the selected edge population is not available or not populated.\\n- The chosen edge population may not have connectivity data indexed for the connectivity metrics endpoint (even though it appears in the circuit structure).\\n- There may be a permissions or data availability restriction for this particular circuit.\\n- A transient server-side issue.\\n\\nImportantly: I did not make any assumptions or add information not returned by the tools \\u2014 the metrics data simply could not be retrieved.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4) Recommended next steps (options you can choose)\\n1. Retry the connectivity metrics call later (transient server error possibility).\\n2. Try a different post node set (for debugging), e.g.:\\n   - pre_node_set = \\Inhibitory\\\", post_node_set = \\All\\\", group_by = \\mtype\\ (I already retried this and got the same Not Found).\\n3. If you want me to continue troubleshooting, I can:\\n   - Attempt the connectivity metrics call grouped by other properties (e.g., \\layer\\ or \\synapse_class\\\") to see if the error is specific to grouping by mtype.\\n   - Request node-set-level connectivity (e.g., specific nodesets like Layer23Inhibitory \\u2192 Layer23Excitatory) to test whether the issue is with the generic Excitatory node set.\\n4. If you prefer, I can open a support request / flag the dataset (you will need to contact platform support or grant me instruction to collect additional diagnostic outputs available via the platform).\\n5. Ask whether you want me to use the circuit-population-data-analysis tool to pull population counts per mtype for inhibitory neurons (this would at least give the distribution of inhibitory mtypes; I can then attempt to correlate with connectivity once connectivity data is available).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5) What I can do next immediately\\n- Re-run the connectivity metrics call with alternative grouping (e.g., \\layer\\\") or alternative post_node_set selections (specific nodesets such as Layer23Excitatory) \\u2014 this may reveal whether the error is general or specific.\\n- Pull per-mtype inhibitory neuron counts from the population table so you have the denominators for any connection-probability calculations when connectivity data becomes available.\\n\\nPlease tell me which of the above next steps you'd like me to take (I will proceed immediately).",

This confirmed:\\n  - Node population: **S1nonbarrel_neurons**\\n  - Available node sets include **Inhibitory**, **Excitatory**, and many layers/node-set names (e.g., Layer2, Layer2Excitatory, L2_* mtypes).\\n  - Chemical edge population available for intra-circuit connections: **S1nonbarrel_neurons__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical**.\\n\\n- I then called the connectivity metrics tool to compute inhibitory\\u2192excitatory connectivity for layer 2 and grouping by mtype using:\\n  - edge_population = \\S1nonbarrel_neurons__S1nonbarrel_neurons__chemical\\\"\\n  - pre_node_set = \\Inhibitory\\\"\\n  - post_node_set = \\Excitatory\\\"\\n  - pre_selection = {\\layer\\\": \\2\\\"}\\n  - post_selection = {\\layer\\\": \\2\\\"}\\n  - group_by = \\mtype\\\"\\n\\n## Result / Error\\nThe connectivity metrics call failed with a 404 Not Found error:\\n{\\detail\\\":\\Not Found\\\"}\\n\\nThis likely means one of:\\n- The selected edge population name is not found for connectivity queries in this circuit (despite being listed in the metrics response), or\\n- The combination of node sets + selections is not valid for the connectivity endpoint, or\\n- A backend endpoint/resource is temporarily unavailable.\\n\\n## Next steps (choose one)\\nI can proceed in several ways \\u2014 please pick one:\\n\\n1) Retry the same connectivity query (in case it was a transient error). I'll re-run the exact call immediately.\\n2) Try alternative but equivalent filters that may be accepted by the connectivity endpoint:\\n   - Use node-set names that explicitly combine layer and cell class (e.g., pre_node_set = \\Layer2Inhibitory\\\", post_node_set = \\Layer2Excitatory\\\") instead of applying layer via pre_selection/post_selection.\\n   - Use pre_selection/post_selection with other property names if available (if the circuit uses a different property key for layer, e.g., \\layer_name\\ \\u2014 I can list available property names and unique values first).\\n3) List available property names and their unique values for the node population so we can be certain the correct property key and values are used in the filter (this is safe and was already partially retrieved, but the detailed property lists can be re-fetched if you want).\\n4) If you prefer, I can run a broader connectivity query (no layer filter) and then filter results locally by layer using the population-analysis tool \\u2014 note this will be slower.\\n\\nWhich option do you want me to run? If you want me to retry or try alternatives, I'll proceed immediately.",

Expand the search to include recordings where brain region metadata is missing or not standardized (remove brain_region filter and search by keywords like \\thalamus\\ in recording notes or search all recordings and filter by text). This may return noisy results.\\n\\n3. Search by species (e.g., *Mus musculus* / mouse) or other filters (recording_type, recording_origin) to narrow results.\\n\\n4.

Below I provide a clear, actionable description of the kinds of simulations the platform supports, typical workflows for creating and running them, and the information you'll need to prepare. Use this as a checklist and guide; for UI-specific steps consult the platform documentation or support.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Supported simulation types (summary)\\n- **Single-neuron simulations** \\u2014 electrical-only E-models (emodels).\\n- **Single-neuron synaptome simulations** \\u2014 morphology + synaptic mapping (ME-model + synaptome).\\n- **Microcircuit / circuit simulations** \\u2014 small circuits, microcircuits, regions, systems, whole-brain scales.\\n- **Synaptome / connection architecture simulations** \\u2014 synapse distribution and connectivity statistics.\\n- **Simulation campaigns** \\u2014 batch/parameter-sweep runs across multiple configurations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Typical simulation workflow (high-level)\\n\\n### 1) Choose a model or circuit\\n- Pick an existing **emodel**, **ME-model**, **synaptome**, or **circuit** from the platform catalog (or upload/create your own).\\n- For atlas-based circuits, pick the brain region and species.\\n\\n### 2) Inspect and (optionally) modify components\\n- Verify neuron populations, morphologies, e-types (electrical models), and connectivity.\\n- Optionally change:\\n  - Neuron population sizes / composition\\n  - Extrinsic inputs or stimulation protocols\\n  - Biophysical parameters (ion-channel densities, synaptic weights, time constants)\\n  - Connectivity rules (probabilities, distance-dependence)\\n\\n### 3) Build a simulation configuration\\n- Provide:\\n  - Target circuit or single neuron ID\\n  - Simulation duration and time-step (dt)\\n  - Recording targets (which variables and which cells / populations to record)\\n  - Stimulation/injection protocol (current clamp, synaptic drives, Poisson inputs)\\n  - Random seeds and number of trials / repeats\\n  - Solver options (integration method, parallelization)\\n- For batch runs: specify parameter ranges for sweeps.\\n\\nNote: If you need a JSON simulation configuration, use the platform\\u2019s simulation-config generator (the platform provides tools to produce full JSON configs from your description).\\n\\n### 4) Validate & initialize\\n- Validate the configuration (the platform typically checks model compatibility and resource needs).\\n- Initialize any ME-model / synaptome preprocessing steps (e.g., synapse placement can be expensive and may run as a preparatory job).\\n\\n### 5) Submit the simulation\\n- Choose compute allocation (local/interactive vs. queued/cluster/cloud).\\n- Start the job; the platform will give job status (queued, running, success, failure).\\n\\n### 6) Monitor and retrieve results\\n- Monitor logs, progress, and resource usage.\\n- Download outputs (spike trains, membrane potentials, synapse counts, summary metrics).\\n- Visualize with platform tools or export to your notebooks.\\n\\n### 7) Postprocessing and analysis\\n- Use platform notebooks or your own scripts to compute metrics (firing rates, correlational structure, LFP proxies, connectivity statistics).\\n- If performing parameter sweeps, aggregate results and visualize parameter-response surfaces.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Minimum information you need to run a simulation\\n- Target model/circuit ID (emodel / me-model / synaptome / circuit)\\n- Species and brain-region context (if applicable)\\n- Simulation length (s) and dt (ms)\\n- Recording list (variables & populations)\\n- Stimulation protocol (type, amplitude, timing)\\n- Number of trials / random seeds\\n- Desired compute resource (if selectable)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Practical tips\\n- Start small: run a short simulation on a reduced-size circuit to validate your config before full runs.\\n- Save reusable configs as templates for later experiments.\\n- For synaptome / ME-model runs, expect preprocessing (synapse placement) to take additional time.\\n- Use reproducible random seeds for comparisons.\\n- For large parameter sweeps, use campaigns/batch jobs to manage multiple runs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## If you want, I can:\\n- Generate a full simulation JSON config from your description (I will use the platform simulation-config generator tool). Provide:\\n  - Circuit or model ID (UUID) to simulate\\n  - Desired simulation parameters (duration, dt, recordings, stimulation, trials, resources)\\n  - Any modifications to populations or connectivity you want applied\\n- Or, provide a checklist tailored to a specific simulation type (single neuron, microcircuit, synaptome).\\n\\nWhich option do you want?
