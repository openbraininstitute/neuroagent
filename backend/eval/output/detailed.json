Identifies a temporally asymmetric plasticity kernel and compartment-specific differences (basal vs oblique dendrites) linking synaptic plasticity to rapid emergence of spatial selectivity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2) **Formation of an expanding memory representation in the hippocampus** \\u2014 Magee, Jeffrey C.

Finds progressive stabilization of place cells accompanied by behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) during formation and retrieval; proposes a cascade-type state model where repeated activation increases neuron-specific likelihood of plasticity rather than requiring fixed long-term weight stabilization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3) **CA3 hippocampal synaptic plasticity supports ripple physiology during memory consolidation** \\u2014 Humeau, Yann (2023)\\n![Figure from paper](https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-42969-x/MediaObjects/41467_2023_42969_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n\\n- **Journal / Type:** Nature Communications (2023)\\n- **Link:** [CA3 hippocampal synaptic plasticity supports ripple physiology during memory consolidation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42969-x?error=cookies_not_supported&code=3d988442-719f-40d6-a426-2a204ff61a60)\\n- **Summary:** Uses AMPAR immobilization to block postsynaptic LTP during a spatial memory task; shows hippocampal synaptic plasticity is engaged during consolidation (sleep) and necessary for ripple-dependent rule consolidation.

Concludes behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) better explains trial-by-trial place-field shifting than Hebbian STDP, with BTSP showing different prevalence and dynamics in CA1 versus CA3.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5) **Modulation of hippocampal plasticity in learning and memory** \\u2014 Fuchsberger & Paulsen (review, 2022)\\n![PubMed image](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image-v2.jpg)\\n\\n- **Journal / Type:** Review (PubMed entry, 2022)\\n- **Link:** [Modulation of hippocampal plasticity in learning and memory (PubMed)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35660989/)\\n- **Summary:** Review covering mechanisms that modulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity and their roles in learning and memory.

    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

For very large datasets you may want to fetch by pages or use `limit`.\\n```python\\n# fetch a limited number (e.g., first 20)\\nmorphs_page = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=20).all()\\nprint(len(morphs_page))\\nfor m in morphs_page:\\n    print(m.id, m.name, getattr(m, \\brain_region\\\", None))\\n```\\n\\n### 4) Show useful fields and assets for each morphology\\n```python\\nfor m in morphs:\\n    print(\\ID:\\\", m.id)\\n    print(\\Name:\\\", m.name)\\n    print(\\Description:\\\", getattr(m, \\description\\\", \\\\\"))\\n    print(\\Subject species:\\\", getattr(m.subject, \\species\\\", None))\\n    print(\\Brain region:\\\", getattr(m.brain_region, \\name\\\", None))\\n    # assets (list of Asset objects) \\u2014 often contains morph files (h5/swcs)\\n    if getattr(m, \\assets\\\", None):\\n        for a in m.assets:\\n            print(\\  Asset:\\\", a.id, a.label, a.content_type, a.file_path if hasattr(a, \\file_path\\\") else None)\\n    print(\\\"-\\ * 40)\\n```\\n\\n### 5) Common filters (examples)\\n- To narrow results, pass a query to `search_entity` (uses the same field names as the entity model):\\n```python\\n# morphologies for a specific MType label\\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}).all()\\n\\n# morphologies in a given brain region id\\nmorphs_in_region = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, query={\\brain_region__hierarchy_id\\\": \\YOUR_REGION_UUID\\\"}).all()\\n```\\n\\n### Notes and tips\\n- Use `m = client.search_entity(...).one()` if you expect a single result and want an error if multiple are returned.\\n- The `limit` parameter can be used to avoid downloading huge result sets at once. The `.all()` helper will page through results transparently.\\n- The exact attributes available on returned objects (e.g., `.assets`, `.subject`, `.mtype`) follow the entityschemata; inspect with `dir(m)` or print `m.__dict__` during development.\\n- See the entitysdk examples (e.g., examples/01_searching.ipynb) for more patterns (uploading assets, registering entities, and mtype classification).\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Provide a complete authenticated example tailored to your auth method (token / OIDC / config file).\\n- Show how to stream large result sets page-by-page to process without holding everything in memory.",

    "ai_response": "## Overview\\n\\nYou can run simulations on the Open Brain Platform at several scales (single neuron, pair, small microcircuit, microcircuit, region, system, whole-brain). The usual workflow is:\\n\\n1. **Choose the simulation scale & goal** (e.g., reproduce firing of a cell, test synaptic connectivity in a microcircuit, run a network response to input).\\n2. **Gather or build required entities** (morphologies, e-models / e-types, me-models, circuit definitions, stimuli, recording probes).\\n3. **Create a simulation configuration** that describes the model, stimulation protocol, recording outputs and runtime parameters.\\n4. **Launch a simulation campaign** (which may contain many simulations or parameter sweeps).\\n5. **Monitor and retrieve results**, then analyze/visualize them (spikes, Vm traces, connectivity metrics, derived measures).\\n6. **Iterate**: change parameters or composition and re-run as needed.\\n\\nBelow I give a concise guide and recommendations for each step.\\n\\n## Which simulation type should you pick?\\n\\n| Scale | Typical use | Typical inputs |\\n|-------|-------------|----------------|\\n| **Single neuron** | Validate/characterize an e-model (ionic conductances) | Emodel (E-type), morphology, current injections, recordings |\\n| **Pair** | Study synaptic interactions, short-term plasticity | Two me-models/emodels, synapse definitions, stimulation schedule |\\n| **Small microcircuit** | Explore motif dynamics (3\\u201320 neurons) | Set of me-models, explicit intrinsic connectivity, input patterns |\\n| **Microcircuit / Region** | Atlas-driven network behavior, population dynamics | Node sets, cell densities, extrinsic connectivity, synaptome |\\n| **System / Whole-brain** | Large-scale interactions (multi-region) | Connected microcircuits/regions, long-range connectivity |\\n\\n## Prepare inputs (data & models)\\n\\n- **Select models**: pick validated e-models or me-models from the platform (or upload your own). Use species/brain-region filters to match biological context.\\n- **Morphologies / cell-types**: ensure morphological exemplars match the e-type if using me-models.\\n- **Connectivity**: for circuits, define node sets and edge populations (intrinsic/extrinsic). The recommended tool sequence for circuit analysis is:\\n  - Get circuit structure first (use circuit metrics)\\n  - Then retrieve connectivity metrics (edge populations, probabilities, synapse counts)\\n- **Stimulation & recordings**: specify current injections, synaptic inputs, optogenetic stimuli, and which variables to record (Vm, spikes, calcium, synaptic currents).\\n- **Simulation runtime**: set duration, dt (time step), random seeds, and HPC/slurm parameters when applicable.\\n\\n## Creating simulation configurations\\n\\n- Simulation configs must fully describe the final state of the simulation (models, connectivity, inputs, outputs, runtime).  \\n- On this platform, you should use the simulation-config generator tool to produce the structured JSON configuration. Note: When you want a simulation JSON generated, the platform requires you to call the generator tool (I can prepare it for you if you provide the circuit/entity IDs and the desired final configuration).\\n- Typical config sections:\\n  - metadata (name, description, campaign id)\\n  - models (entity IDs for e-models / me-models)\\n  - network (node sets, connection rules or explicit edges)\\n  - stimuli (time course, targets)\\n  - probes (what variables to record and where)\\n  - runtime (tstop, dt, integration method)\\n  - outputs (which files to save, derived metrics)\\n\\n## Launching and running\\n\\n- Simulations can be run interactively (short single-neuron tests) or as part of a simulation campaign for parameter sweeps and batch jobs.\\n- Use reasonable time steps (dt) and tolerances depending on model stiffness; smaller dt increases accuracy and runtime.\\n- For larger circuits, use HPC/back-end resources provided by the platform; specify resource requests in the campaign config.\\n\\n## Monitoring and results\\n\\n- Typical outputs: spike rasters, Vm traces, per-cell quantities, connectivity-derived measures, and aggregated metrics (firing rates, synchrony).\\n- Check simulation logs for integration warnings, instabilities, or failed recordings.\\n- If results are large, download selectively (compressed traces, or derived CSV/NetCDF formats).\\n\\n## Common pitfalls & tips\\n\\n- Mismatch between morphology and e-model: verify that ionic channel distributions expected by the e-model are compatible with the morphology used.\\n- Unstable integration: if Vm explodes, try smaller dt, reduce strong currents, or use more stable integration settings.\\n- Connectivity errors: ensure node set IDs and edge-population IDs referenced in the config exist and match the circuit structure.\\n- Random seeds: set seeds for reproducibility; for sweeps, vary seeds systematically.\\n- Start small: validate single neurons and small motifs before running full microcircuit/region simulations.\\n\\n## How I can help right now\\n\\n- I can generate a complete simulation JSON configuration for a specific circuit or model. To do that I\\u2019ll need:\\n  - **Circuit/entity IDs** (UUIDs) you want to simulate (or tell me you want to build one)\\n  - The **scale/type** of simulation you want (single neuron, pair, microcircuit, etc.)\\n  - Key parameters: runtime (tstop, dt), stimuli, probes, any modifications to models (e.g., change gbar), and whether you want a campaign or a single run.\\n\\nImportant: when you want me to produce the actual simulation config JSON, I will call the platform generator tool to create it (the platform requires that). If you want me to prepare it now, provide the IDs and a full description of the desired final configuration and I will generate the config for you.\\n\\n## Resources and next steps\\n\\n- If you need a walkthrough of a specific simulation (e.g., simulate a Layer 5 pyramidal neuron current injection, or run a microcircuit response to Poisson background), tell me:\\n  - Which model/circuit IDs to use (or ask me to find available entities)\\n  - Exact stimulation and recording details\\n- If you want I can:\\n  - Draft a complete simulation config (and then call the generator tool to produce the JSON), or\\n  - Help you locate models/circuits on the platform (I can run EntityCore queries if you provide search terms).\\n\\nWould you like me to prepare a simulation config now? If yes, specify the circuit/model IDs (or describe what to build) and the simulation parameters you want.",

It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.
