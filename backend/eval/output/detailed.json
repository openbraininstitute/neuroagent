    "expected_output": "## Overview\n\nBelow are examples showing how to retrieve (list) all CellMorphology entities using the Open Brain Platform Python SDK (entitysdk). I include:\n\n- A minimal example that fetches a limited set (safe default).\n- A full \\u201cget all\\u201d pattern that pages through results until all items are retrieved.\n- Notes about pagination and total_items (required by EntityCore rules).\n\nAll examples assume you have an authenticated `client` instance from the entitysdk (see your project/docs for authentication). Replace any placeholder values (API keys, endpoints) per your environment.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Minimal / quick preview (limit results)\n\nThis fetches a limited number of morphologies (e.g., 10) \\u2014 useful for quick checks.\n\n```python\n# Example: quick fetch (limit 10)\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\n# instantiate client (fill in auth details per your setup)\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")  # adapt to your auth method\n\n# search for CellMorphology with a limit (safe preview)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology, limit=10).all()\n\nprint(f\\Retrieved {len(morphs)} morphologies (preview)\\\")\nfor m in morphs:\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recommended: Retrieve ALL morphologies with pagination (robust)\n\nThe EntityCore \\u201cGET ALL\\u201d may paginate. This pattern requests pages until all items are retrieved. It also prints the reported total_items so you can decide whether to continue if needed.\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# page_size should be <= service max (commonly 10); adapt if docs show different max\npage_size = 10\npage = 1\nall_morphs = []\n\nwhile True:\n    result = client.search_entity(\n        entity_type=CellMorphology,\n        limit=page_size,\n        offset=(page - 1) * page_size  # note: some clients use page/offset; adjust if client API differs\n    ).page(page)  # if client provides a page method; otherwise use offset/limit pattern\n\n    # If your client returns a wrapper with items and total_items:\n    items = result.items if hasattr(result, \\items\\\") else result  # adapt to the client response structure\n    total_items = getattr(result,       otal_items\\\", None)\n\n    # Collect items\n    all_morphs.extend(items)\n\n    # Display progress\n    if total_items is not None:\n        print(f\\Fetched page {page}. collected {len(all_morphs)} of {total_items}\\\")\n\n    # Stop when fewer items returned than page_size OR we've reached total_items\n    if len(items) < page_size:\n        break\n    if total_items is not None and len(all_morphs) >= total_items:\n        break\n\n    page += 1\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies retrieved: {len(all_morphs)}\\\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The entitysdk has multiple helpers; if it exposes a `.all()` or `.iterate()` convenience that automatically pages, prefer that. Example from docs: `client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()`.\n- Always check the client response structure for fields like `items`, `total_items`, `limit`, `offset`, or built-in iterators.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Using the entitysdk convenience method shown in examples (single call)\n\nThe entitysdk examples show a convenient pattern using search_entity(...).all() to fetch results. If the SDK supports retrieving all with `.all()`, use that:\n\n```python\nfrom entitysdk import Client\nfrom entitysdk.entities import CellMorphology\n\nclient = Client(api_key=\\YOUR_API_KEY\\\")\n\n# If the client supports .all() to fetch everything (with internal paging)\nmorphs = client.search_entity(entity_type=CellMorphology).all()\n\nprint(f\\Total morphologies returned: {len(morphs)}\\\")\nfor m in morphs[:10]:  # show first 10\n    print(m.id, m.name)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4) Filtering examples (by mtype or species)\n\nYou can pass query filters to narrow results (examples from docs):\n\n- Find morphologies for a specific MType label:\n\n```python\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n- Limit by species (scientific name):\n\n```python\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\n    entity_type=CellMorphology,\n    query={\\subject__species__name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}\n).all()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Important Platform / EntityCore rules (summary)\n\n- When calling GET ALL endpoints, mention and check `total_items`. Ask before using extra pages if you need to avoid large downloads.\n- The EntityCore examples show `client.search_entity(...).all()` as a convenient approach; it may already page for you.\n- The SDK examples in the repo demonstrate additional workflows: uploading assets, registering morphologies, adding MType classifications \\u2014 see the entitysdk examples for full patterns.\n\n---\n\nIf you\\u2019d like:\n- I can produce a ready-to-run script tailored to your auth method (API key / OAuth) \\u2014 tell me which auth you use.\n- Or I can show an example using explicit entitycore API parameters (page, page_size) adapted to the exact client methods you have \\u2014 tell me which entitysdk version or client functions you see.\n",

    "ai_response": "I'll fetch the official entitysdk Python documentation so I can provide an authoritative, up-to-date example for listing cell morphologies. With that reference I will show the minimal authentication setup and a complete Python snippet to list all cell morphologies (with pagination guidance).## Overview\\n\\nBelow are concise, runnable examples (in Python) showing how to list cell morphologies with the Open Brain Platform `entitysdk`. Examples cover:\\n- authentication / client initialization,\\n- listing all morphologies (iterator / pagination-safe),\\n- filtering by species or mtype,\\n- retrieving details from each returned morphology object.\\n\\nThese examples follow the official entitysdk usage patterns.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1) Authentication and client initialization\\n\\nUse an environment token (or token manager) and a ProjectContext. Adjust `entitycore_api_url` or environment settings for staging as needed.\\n\\n```python\\nimport os\\nfrom entitysdk.client import Client\\nfrom entitysdk.common import ProjectContext\\n\\n# Replace these with your project-specific IDs or use the environment-based client if available\\nentitycore_api_url = \\https://entitycore.openbrain.org\\   # example; use your API URL\\nproject_context = ProjectContext(\\n    virtual_lab_id=\\a98b7abc-fc46-4700-9e3d-37137812c730\\\",\\n    project_id=\\0dbced5f-cc3d-488a-8c7f-cfb8ea039dc6\\\",\\n)\\n\\n# token can come from environment\\ntoken = os.getenv(\\ACCESS_TOKEN\\\", \\YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\\\")\\n\\n# create client\\nclient = Client(api_url=entitycore_api_url, project_context=project_context, token_manager=token)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2) List cell morphologies (safe for large sets)\\n\\nThe SDK returns an iterator for `client.search_entity`. Use `limit=None` to request all results (the iterator will yield pages internally). Iterating is memory-friendly; use `.all()` only if you are confident results fit in memory.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk import models\\n\\n# Get an iterator for all CellMorphology entities (limit=None streams all results)\\nmorph_iter = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, limit=None)\\n\\n# Iterate through results (pagination handled internally by the iterator)\\nfor morph in morph_iter:\\n    print(f\\ID: {morph.id}\\\")\\n    print(f\\Name: {morph.name}\\\")\\n    # The morphology object exposes other fields commonly available:\\n    # morph.description, morph.mtype, morph.subject, morph.measurements, etc.\\n    print(\\\"---\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNotes:\\n- Using `limit=None` lets the client stream all matches; if the dataset is very large, page through with a finite `limit` and track an offset (or consume the iterator in chunks).\\n- If you prefer a short test (first N results), set `limit=10`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3) Retrieve full details for a single morphology\\n\\nThe morphology objects returned by `search_entity` include common metadata such as `id`, `name`, `description`, and related fields (subject, measurements, assets, mtypes). Access them directly from the returned object:\\n\\n```python\\n# Get one morphology (first matching)\\nfirst_morph = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, limit=1).one()\\n\\nprint(\\ID:\\\", first_morph.id)\\nprint(\\Name:\\\", first_morph.name)\\nprint(\\Description:\\\", first_morph.description)\\n# Example related attributes:\\n# print(first_morph.subject)\\n# print(first_morph.mtype)\\n# print(first_morph.measurements)\\n# print(first_morph.assets)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4) Filtering examples\\n\\nFilter by species, by mtype label, or other supported query keys by passing a `query` dict to `search_entity`.\\n\\n- Filter by species name (example: Mus musculus):\\n```python\\nfrom entitysdk.models import Species\\n\\n# Find Species entity (optional) \\u2014 helps if you want ID-based queries\\nspecies_results = client.search_entity(entity_type=Species, query={\\name\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"}, limit=10)\\nspecies_match = species_results.one()  # or iterate / .all()\\nprint(\\Species ID:\\\", species_match.id, \\Name:\\\", species_match.name)\\n\\n# Query morphologies by species label in a compound query\\nmorphs_mouse = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    query={\\subject__species__label\\\": \\Mus musculus\\\"},\\n    limit=None\\n)\\nfor m in morphs_mouse:\\n    print(m.id, m.name)\\n```\\n\\n- Filter by mtype preferred label (example: 'SR_PC'):\\n```python\\nmorphs_sr_pc = client.search_entity(\\n    entity_type=models.CellMorphology,\\n    query={\\mtype__pref_label\\\": \\SR_PC\\\"},\\n    limit=None\\n)\\nfor m in morphs_sr_pc:\\n    print(m.id, m.name)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5) Pagination control (if you need explicit pages)\\n\\nIf you want to fetch pages explicitly rather than relying on the iterator internals, use a finite `limit` and iterate the returned iterator repeatedly (or use `.all()` / `.one()` carefully). The iterator itself handles paging internally, so explicit offset management is rarely needed when using `search_entity`.\\n\\nExample pattern for manual chunked consumption:\\n```python\\nchunk_size = 100\\nit = client.search_entity(entity_type=models.CellMorphology, limit=chunk_size)\\n\\n# The iterator yields up to chunk_size items per internal request; consuming it in a loop\\n# will fetch subsequent pages transparently until exhausted.\\nfor morph in it:\\n    process(morph)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6) Practical tips and caveats\\n\\n- Prefer streaming with `limit=None` for complete lists but be mindful of processing time and result size.\\n- Use specific `query` filters to reduce result size (species, brain region, mtype, creation date, etc.).\\n- Returned model objects typically include fields such as `id`, `name`, `description`, `subject`, `mtype`, `measurements`, and `assets` \\u2014 inspect the object in your session to confirm available attributes for your deployment/version.\\n- For staging or environment-specific authentication, use the SDK's documented token helpers (the examples referenced include staging token retrieval).\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- provide a ready-to-run script that saves morphologies metadata to CSV,\\n- show how to fetch and download associated assets (if available),\\n- or tailor the query to a specific brain region or species.

    "expected_output": "## Single Cell Simulation Example (OBI-One)\n\nBelow is a step-by-step single-cell simulation example using the OBI-One Python API (openbraininstitute/obi-one). It shows how to:\n\n- select an MEModel (morphology+electrical model),\n- build and validate a simulation configuration (stimulus, recordings, timestamps),\n- generate a grid-scan / single simulation,\n- and run the simulation with BlueCelluLab (the usual backend used in OBI-One examples).\n\nYou will need obi_one installed and configured, plus credentials / db_client as required by your environment. Replace placeholder IDs (e.g., <MEMODEL-ID>) and file paths with real values.\n\n### 1) Select an MEModel to simulate\n```python\n# Option A: use a known MEModel ID\nentity_ID = \\\"<MEMODEL-ID>\\  # <<< Replace with real MEModel UUID\n\n# Option B: (interactive selection helper used in examples)\n# memodel_ids = get_entities.get_entities(\\memodel\\\", token, memodel_ids,\n#                                         project_context=project_context,\n#                                         multi_select=False,\n#                                         default_scale=\\small\\\")\n# memodel_ids[0] would then be used below\n```\n\n### 2) Build the MEModel simulation configuration (form API)\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport obi_one as obi\n\n# === Parameters ===\nsim_duration = 3000.0  # ms\n\n# Create an empty config for MEModel-based simulation\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\n\n# Info block\ninfo = obi.Info(\n    campaign_name=\\MEModel Simulation\\\",\n    campaign_description=\\Single-cell MEModel simulation with constant current stimulus\\\"\n)\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\n\n# Regular timestamps (example: a single repetition covering simulation)\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(start_time=0.0, number_of_repetitions=1, interval=sim_duration)\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name='RegularTimestamps')\n\n# Somatic current clamp stimulus (Constant current)\nstimulus = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\n    duration=2000.0,\n    amplitude=0.5  # nA (example)\n)\nsim_conf.add(stimulus, name=\\CurrentClampInput\\\")\n\n# Record soma voltage\nvoltage_recording = obi.SomaVoltageRecording()\nsim_conf.add(voltage_recording, name='VoltageRecording')\n\n# Optionally limit the time window recorded\ntime_window_voltage_recording = obi.TimeWindowSomaVoltageRecording(start_time=0.0, end_time=2000.0)\nsim_conf.add(time_window_voltage_recording, name='TimeWindowVoltageRecording')\n\n# Initialization: point to the MEModel by ID and set simulation length\nsimulations_initialize = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=entity_ID),\n    simulation_length=sim_duration\n)\nsim_conf.set(simulations_initialize, name='initialize')\n\n# Validate and get validated configuration object\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\nprint(\\Validated config:\\\", validated_sim_conf)\n```\n\n### 3) Wrap config into a GridScan / single simulation configuration\n(OBI-One uses GridScan tasks to generate concrete config files; for a single point you still create a grid with a single cell)\n```python\n# Create a GridScan generation task for the validated form\ngrid_scan = obi.GridScanGenerationTask(\n    form=validated_sim_conf,\n    coordinate_directory_option=\\ZERO_INDEX\\\",\n    output_root='../../../obi-output/memodel_simulations/grid_scan'  # change to desired output\n)\n\n# (Optional) inspect multi-value parameters or coordinates\ngrid_scan.multiple_value_parameters(display=True)\ngrid_scan.coordinate_parameters(display=True)\n\n# Execute generation (requires db_client configured)\ngrid_scan.execute(db_client=db_client)\n```\n\n### 4) Run the generated simulation with BlueCelluLab backend\n```python\nfrom obi_one.scientific.library.simulation_execution import run\n\n# Path to simulation_config.json from generated single config\nsimulation_config_path = grid_scan.single_configs[0].coordinate_output_root / \\simulation_config.json\\\"\nprint(\\Simulation config path:\\\", simulation_config_path)\n\n# Run the simulation (bluecellulab is typical)\nrun(\n    simulation_config=simulation_config_path,\n    simulatorluecellulab\\\",  # or \neurodamus\\\"\n    save_nwb=False  # optionally save NWB\n)\n```\n\n### 5) Load and analyze results with bluepysnap\n```python\nimport bluepysnap\n\nsnap_simulation = bluepysnap.Simulation(simulation_config_path)\nspikes = snap_simulation.spikes\n\nprint(\\spikes time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", spikes.time_start, spikes.time_stop, spikes.dt)\nprint(\\population names:\\\", spikes.population_names)\n\n# Access soma voltage report\nsoma_report = snap_simulation.reports['SomaVoltage']\nprint(\\SomaVoltage time_start, time_stop, dt:\\\", soma_report.time_start, soma_report.time_stop, soma_report.dt)\n\n# Example: inspect the head of the spike report dataframe\nfiltered = spikes.filter(t_start=spikes.time_start, t_stop=spikes.time_stop)\nprint(filtered.report.head())\n```\n\n## Notes, tips and placeholders\n- **Replace** <MEMODEL-ID> with the actual MEModel UUID from EntityCore.\n- You need a configured db_client variable (OBI-One examples use a DB client for GridScan generation) \\u2014 ensure you have credentials and environment set up as per your installation.\n- If you prefer to pick an MEModel interactively or via EntityCore queries, use the platform's EntityCore helpers to get MEModel IDs (examples in the repository show interactive selection).\n- The examples above are adapted from the OBI-One example notebooks:\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_simulation.ipynb\n  - examples/F_single_cell_simulations/entitysdk_memodel_with_synapses_simulation.ipynb\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- provide a minimal runnable script adjusted to your environment (if you give me the MEModel ID and where your db_client/config is stored),\n- or show how to query EntityCore for available MEModels and pick one programmatically.

Replace **memodel_id_here** with the MEModel ID available in your project.\\n\\nNote: the snippets shown here use the obi-one configuration objects and end with a validated configuration object ready to be executed by your simulation backend (submit/run step depends on your local platform or execution API).\\n\\n### Reasoning for the next step\\nTo create a single-cell simulation we must (1) define metadata and timing, (2) select the ME-model to simulate, (3) add stimulus and recordings, and (4) validate the configuration so it can be executed by the simulation runner.\\n\\n### Example code\\n\\n```python\\n# single_cell_me_model_simulation.py\\nimport obi_one as obi\\n\\n# --- 1) Simulation parameters and metadata ---\\nsim_duration = 2000.0  # ms\\n\\ninfo = obi.Info(\\n    campaign_name=\\Single-cell MEModel demo\\\",\\n    campaign_description=\\Minimal single-cell ME-model simulation with somatic current-clamp\\\"\\n)\\n\\n# --- 2) Create an empty MEModelSimulationScanConfig ---\\nsim_conf = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.empty_config()\\nsim_conf.set(info, name=\\info\\\")\\n\\n# --- 3) Timing / timestamps (optional but useful for stimuli) ---\\nregular_timestamps = obi.RegularTimestamps(\\n    start_time=0.0,\\n    number_of_repetitions=1,\\n    interval=sim_duration\\n)\\nsim_conf.add(regular_timestamps, name=\\regular_timestamps\\\")\\n\\n# --- 4) Define the stimulus (somatic current clamp) ---\\n# Use a single amplitude (nA). You can pass a list to create a scan over amplitudes.\\ncurrent_stim = obi.ConstantCurrentClampSomaticStimulus(\\n    timestamps=regular_timestamps.ref,\\n    delay=100.0,       # ms delay before injection\\n    duration=500.0,    # ms duration of injection\\n    amplitude=0.5      # nA\\n)\\nsim_conf.add(current_stim, name=\\somatic_current_clamp\\\")\\n\\n# --- 5) Define recordings (soma voltage) ---\\nsoma_volt = obi.SomaVoltageRecording(\\n    # if needed, you can reference a neuron/ID set; for MEModelFromID the initialize block usually selects the model\\n    start_time=0.0,\\n    end_time=sim_duration\\n)\\nsim_conf.add(soma_volt, name=\\soma_voltage_recording\\\")\\n\\n# --- 6) Initialization: point to the ME-model to simulate ---\\n# Replace the placeholder with a real MEModel ID available in your environment:\\nmemodel_id = \\memodel_id_here\\\"\\nsim_init = obi.MEModelSimulationScanConfig.Initialize(\\n    circuit=obi.MEModelFromID(id_str=memodel_id),\\n    simulation_length=sim_duration,\\n    v_init=-70.0,           # mV initial membrane potential\\n    random_seed=42\\n)\\nsim_conf.set(sim_init, name=\\initialize\\\")\\n\\n# --- 7) Validate the configuration (produces a validated_config object) ---\\nvalidated_sim_conf = sim_conf.validated_config()\\n\\n# The validated_sim_conf is now ready to be consumed by your runner/executor.\\n# Example: inspect the validated configuration\\nprint(\\Validated config ready. Summary:\\\")\\nprint(validated_sim_conf.summary() if hasattr(validated_sim_conf, \\summary\\\") else validated_sim_conf)\\n```\\n\\n### What to do next\\n- Provide a valid MEModel ID (for example from the EntityCore/MEModel catalog in your project) and rerun the script.\\n- Use your local or platform-specific simulation runner to execute the validated configuration. The exact invocation to run the validated config depends on your deployment (not shown here); validated_config is the canonical object to hand over to the runner.\\n\\nIf you want, I can:\\n- Show an example that scans multiple stimulus amplitudes (creates multiple coordinates), or\\n- Help locate MEModel IDs in your project (I can show how to query EntityCore to list available MEModel entities). Which would you like next?",
