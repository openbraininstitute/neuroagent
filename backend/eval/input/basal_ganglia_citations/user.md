Find relevant citations for the following paragraph on Basal Ganglia computational models:

Basal ganglia models range from rate-based abstractions to biologically detailed spiking networks, capturing direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways, dopaminergic prediction error signaling, and reinforcement learning mechanisms. Frameworks such as temporal-difference learning and actor-critic architectures map circuit dynamics to behavioral adaptation, motor control, and pathologies like Parkinson's disease.
