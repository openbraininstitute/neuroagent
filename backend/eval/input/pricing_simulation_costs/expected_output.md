## Simulation Costs

Simulation costs depend on your plan (Free or Pro) and the type of simulation you're running.

### Simulation Costs by Plan

| Simulation Type | Free Plan | Pro Plan |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| **E-model** | 1 credit/simulation | 0.5 credits/simulation |
| **Ion channel** | 1 credit/simulation | 0.5 credits/simulation |
| **Single cell** | 1 credit/simulation | 0.5 credits/simulation |
| **Synaptome** | 1 credit/simulation | 0.5 credits/simulation |
| **Small microcircuit** (≤10 neurons) | 10 credits/simulation | 5 credits/simulation |
| **Microcircuit** (>10 neurons) | 0.05 credits/neuron/second of biological time | 0.025 credits/neuron/second of biological time |

### Credits Included

- **Free Plan:** 100 free initial credits (expire in 1 year)
- **Pro Plan Monthly:** 50 free credits/month (CHF 25/month)
- **Pro Plan Yearly:** 650 free credits/year (CHF 275/year)

### Cost Savings with Pro

The Pro plan offers approximately **50% cost reduction** on all simulation types:
- Basic simulations: 0.5 vs 1 credit
- Small microcircuits: 5 vs 10 credits
- Large microcircuits: Half the per-neuron cost

### Example Calculations

- **10 single cell simulations on Free:** 10 credits
- **10 single cell simulations on Pro:** 5 credits
- **100-neuron circuit for 1 second on Free:** 5 credits (100 × 0.05)
- **100-neuron circuit for 1 second on Pro:** 2.5 credits (100 × 0.025)
