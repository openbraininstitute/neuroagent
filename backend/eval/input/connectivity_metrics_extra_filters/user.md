Can you analyze the connectivity patterns in circuit 2eb602ea-9ffc-42a2-9fb7-5234921343d0? I specifically want to analyze the connections from inhibitory neurons to excitatory neurons, but only for layer 2.

Please focus specifically on inhibitory-to-excitatory connections in layer 2. Add layer=2 as a filter for both pre_selection and post_selection. Also, group by the mtype.
