Can you analyze the connectivity patterns in circuit 2eb602ea-9ffc-42a2-9fb7-5234921343d0? I specifically want to analyze the connections from inhibitory neurons to excitatory neurons.

Please focus specifically on inhibitory-to-excitatory connections. There's no need to add any extra pre_selection or post_selection filters - just specifying the node sets is enough. Also, group by the mtype.
