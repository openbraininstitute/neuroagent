I've generated a simulation configuration for circuit abc123 with the following specifications:

- **Neuron Set:** 100 neurons
- **Duration:** 500ms
- **Stimulus:** Current clamp at 50ms

The configuration has been created and is ready to use. You can now proceed with running the simulation or make further modifications if needed.
