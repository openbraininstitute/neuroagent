I am building a Jansen-Rit-Wendling type neural mass model representing a cortical column with four subpopulations: pyramidal cells, excitatory interneurons, SST neurons, and PV cells. Can you help me find empirical and modeling literature to estimate the PSP amplitude and time constants for each cell type, as well as the proportion of synaptic connections between all subpopulations? Focus on cortical regions and include references.
