Here's a summary of your current simulation configuration:

- **Circuit:** abc123
- **Duration:** 500 ms
- **Time step (dt):** 0.025 ms
- **Conditions:**
  - Temperature: 34°C
  - Initial voltage: -65 mV
- **Stimulus:** Current clamp
  - Delay: 50 ms
  - Duration: 200 ms
  - Amplitude: 0.5 nA
- **Neuron set:** All population, limited to 100 neurons

The simulation is configured to run a current clamp experiment on 100 neurons from the "All" population of circuit abc123, injecting a 0.5 nA current starting at 50 ms for 200 ms, under standard physiological conditions (34°C, resting potential at -65 mV).
