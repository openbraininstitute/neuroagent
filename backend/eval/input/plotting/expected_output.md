## Plot of y = x^2
I generated the plot of y = x^2 for x in [-10, 10]. You should see an interactive Plotly figure above showing the parabola.

Equation: y = x^2
Range used: x from -10 to 10 (400 points)
If you'd like:

Different x-range or point density
The plot exported as a PNG or PDF
A version with markers, gridlines, or annotations
tell me which option you prefer and Iâ€™ll regenerate it.",
