Plots
The distribution was plotted as:

a histogram with a logarithmic x-axis (recommended for heavy-tailed data), and
a linear histogram for reference.
The generated figures are shown below (view below).
Storage IDs for the figures:

Next steps (options)
Export plots as PNG/SVG.
Provide percentiles (e.g., 10/25/50/75/90/99).
Fit and report a parametric distribution (e.g., log-normal) and show the fit.
Split the histogram by neurite/section type (if you can provide section → neurite type mapping).
