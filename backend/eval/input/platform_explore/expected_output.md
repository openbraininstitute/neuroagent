I can't see the platform UI
I don't have access to the Open Brain Platform user interface, so I can't see or describe where the Explore button is located in the layout.

What I can recommend
Check the platform's documentation or Help pages (often labelled "Docs", "Help", or "Support").
Look for a main navigation bar (top or side); features like "Explore", "Browse", or "Atlas" are commonly placed there.
Search the platform for keywords "Explore" or "Browse" using any search field available.
Contact platform support or your administrator if you still can't find it.
If you want, I can:

Search the platform documentation or news records for mentions of the Explore feature (I can run a document search). Would you like me to do that?
