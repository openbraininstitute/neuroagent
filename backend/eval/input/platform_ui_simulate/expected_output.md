I don't have access to the platform's UI and can't tell you where features are located in the interface.

Alternatives I can offer:

Check the platform documentation or Help pages for a "Simulations", "Simulation", or "Run simulation" section.
Search the site for keywords like "simulation", "simulation campaign", "simulation execution", or "simulation notebook".
Contact the platform support team or your administrator for guided navigation.
If you want, I can search the platform documentation or news/tutorial pages for mentions of the simulation feature â€” tell me which of those you'd like me to look up (documentation/tutorials/news/public projects).
