Useful quick-start tips for brain researchers

Use Advanced Search to narrow results by brain region, disease, model system, or species.
Use Clinical Queries for clinically oriented keyword filtering.
Access MeSH to explore controlled vocabulary terms related to neurological topics.
Check the E-utilities API for programmatic access to PubMed citations, abstracts, and linking to full text.
How I can help next
If you want, I can:

Perform a targeted PubMed search for a brain-related topic (e.g., neurodegenerative disease, synaptic plasticity, rodent electrophysiology).
Retrieve a list of relevant articles with metadata (titles, authors, journals, DOIs) and provide brief summaries.
Extract MeSH terms and propose keywords to refine your search.
Retrieve full-text links (where available) and summarize key findings from specific papers.
Tell me your brain topic of interest (e.g., “tauopathies in mice,” “cortical interneuron connectivity,” “mitophagy in neurons”), and I’ll pull a focused PubMed results subset.
