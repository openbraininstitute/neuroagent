This could be a single neuron model, a synaptome model, or other available models like metabolism or NGV unit.\n\n2. **Access the Simulation Notebook**: The platform provides notebooks for different simulations. You can download and execute these notebooks remotely. Soon, there will be an option to run them directly on the platform.\n\n3. **Customize the Model**: You can customize the model by changing cellular composition, neuron types, or other parameters to fit your experimental needs.\n\n4. **Run the Simulation**: Execute the simulation using the provided tools or notebooks. This will generate results based on the model and parameters you set.\n\n5. **Analyze Results**: Use the platform's analysis tools to interpret the simulation output.\n\nIf you want, I can guide you to specific simulation models or notebooks available on the platform or provide detailed instructions for a particular type of simulation.
