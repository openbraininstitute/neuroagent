test_case_1,How can I simulate on the platform ?,"To simulate on the Open Brain Platform, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Choose a Model Type**: The platform offers various models such as single neuron models, synaptome models, metabolism and NGV unit models, and more. Decide which scale and type of model you want to simulate.\n\n2. **Select or Create a Model**:\n   - You can select from existing models available on the platform.\n   - Alternatively, you can customize existing models or create your own by changing cellular composition or other parameters.\n\n3. **Set Up Simulation Parameters**:\n   - Define the simulation conditions, such as input stimuli, duration, and other relevant parameters.\n   - For single neuron simulations, you might specify electrical properties or morphology details.\n\n4. **Run the Simulation**:\n   - Currently, simulations can be run by downloading and executing notebooks remotely.\n   - A feature to run simulations directly on the platform will be available soon.\n\n5. **Analyze Results**:\n   - After running the simulation, analyze the output data using the platform's tools or your own analysis pipelines.\n\nIf you want, I can guide you through specific simulation types or help you find relevant models and resources on the platform. Let me know what kind of simulation you are interested in!",Correctness [GEval],0.459178,False,0.500000,"The actual output provides a general overview of simulating on the Open Brain Platform but lacks the specific step-by-step instructions for simulating a single neuron model as outlined in the expected output.

test_case_2,What are some recent studies on neuron morphology in the cerebrum?,"Here are some recent studies on neuron morphology in the cerebrum:\n\n### 1. Key morphological features of human pyramidal neurons\n- **Published:** May 14, 2024\n- **Summary:** This study performed intracellular injections and 3D reconstructions of over 200 pyramidal neurons from the human occipital primary visual area and associative temporal cortex. It found that pyramidal neurons in the temporal cortex are larger and more complex than those in the primary sensory cortex, with more dendritic spines. The study also compared human neocortical neurons to hippocampal and mouse neurons, highlighting species-specific morphological differences.\n- **Link:** [PMC Article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11094408/)\n\n### 2. What makes human cortical pyramidal neurons functionally complex\n- **Published:** December 17, 2024\n- **Summary:** This research explores the functional complexity of human cortical pyramidal neurons, focusing on their morphology and how it relates to their function.\n- **Link:** [BioRxiv Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.17.628883v1.full)\n\n### 3. Whole human-brain mapping of single cortical neurons for profiling\n- **Published:** October 13, 2023\n- **Summary:** The study introduces adaptive cell tomography (ACTomography) to map and image 1746 cortical neurons from human brain tissues. This approach allows detailed 3D imaging and morphological quantification of neurons at the whole-brain scale.\n- **Link:** [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf3771)\n\n### 4. Morphological diversity of single neurons in molecularly defined cell types\n- **Published:** October 6, 2021\n- **Summary:** This paper discusses the extraordinary diversity of neurons across molecular, morphological, physiological, and connectional features, emphasizing the importance of integrating these properties for accurate classification and mapping of cell types.\n- **Link:** [Nature Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03941-1)\n\n### 5. Measurements of neuronal morphological variation across the rat cerebral cortex\n- **Published:** August 24, 2020\n- **Summary:** This study measures morphological variations of neurons across different areas of the rat cerebral cortex, providing insights into structural diversity.\n- **Link:** [Neuroscience Letters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394020303475)\n\nIf you want more details on any of these studies or additional papers, please let me know!",Correctness [GEval],0.649330,True,0.500000,"The actual output provides relevant studies on neuron morphology in the cerebrum, addressing the input question effectively.
