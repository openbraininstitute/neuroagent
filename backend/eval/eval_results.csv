How to Simulate a Single Neuron Model on the Platform
Access Virtual Lab:

From the homepage, click the ""Go to Virtual Lab"" button.
Manage Projects:

Click on ""Projects"" in the left menu to see your projects.
Create a project if none exists.
Ensure you have credits in your project; transfer credits from your virtual lab if needed.
Build a Single Neuron Model:

Click on the ""Build"" column in the left panel.
Click the ""Build"" button in the single neuron tile.
Name your model, optionally add a description.
Select the brain region (e.g., primary somatosensory area).
Click ""Start building.""
Select a 3D reconstructed morphology (M model) and an existing electrical model (E model).
Filter morphologies by type (e.g., L5 TPC-A for thick tufted layer 5 pyramidal neuron).
Select the appropriate E model matching the morphology.
Save the created morph-electric model (M E model).
Simulate the Neuron Model:

Go back to your project homepage.
Click on the ""Simulate"" tab, then ""Single Neuron.""
Find your neuron model or search by name.
Click your model and press ""New Simulation.""
In the simulation window, pan, rotate, and zoom the neuron morphology.
Set experiment and simulation parameters.
Choose predefined current injection protocols or customize current steps.
Add multiple recording locations by clicking on the morphology or using the ""Add Recording"" button.
Press ""Simulate"" to run the simulation.
View and Save Results:

The ""Results"" tab will display recordings from selected locations.
Save recordings or save them to the library for later access.

If you want, I can guide you through any specific step or help you start a simulation on the platform.

","To simulate on the Open Brain Platform, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Choose the Type of Simulation:**\n   - Single neuron simulation\n   - Synaptome simulation\n   - Metabolism and NGV unit simulation\n   - Future options include microcircuits, brain regions, brain systems, and whole brain simulations.\n\n2. **Select or Create Models:**\n   - Use existing neuron morphologies, electrical models (e-models), or combined morphology-electrical models (me-models).\n   - Customize or create your own models by changing cellular composition or other parameters.\n\n3. **Configure Simulation Parameters:**\n   - Define the simulation settings such as duration, stimuli, recording parameters, and other relevant configurations.\n\n4. **Run the Simulation:**\n   - Currently, simulations can be run remotely by downloading notebooks provided on the platform.\n   - Soon, the platform will support running simulations directly online.\n\n5. **Analyze Results:**\n   - Use the platform's tools to visualize and analyze simulation outputs.\n\nIf you want, I can guide you through specific simulation types or help you find existing simulations or models on the platform. Would you like to start with a particular simulation type or need help with configuration?",Correctness [GEval],0.524446,True,0.500000,"The actual output provides a general overview of simulating on the Open Brain Platform, which partially addresses the input question. However, it lacks the specific step-by-step instructions for simulating a single neuron model as outlined in the expected output. While it covers various types of simulations and configuration details, it does not directly follow the structure or content of the expected tutorial, leading to a significant gap in alignment.",gpt-4o-mini,0.000284
