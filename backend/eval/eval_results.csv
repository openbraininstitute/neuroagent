Key morphological features of human pyramidal neurons\n- **Published:** May 14, 2024\n- **Summary:** This study performed intracellular injections and 3D reconstructions of over 200 pyramidal neurons from human occipital primary visual area and associative temporal cortex. It found that pyramidal neurons in the temporal cortex are larger and more complex than those in primary sensory cortex, with more dendritic spines. The study also compared human neocortical neurons to hippocampal and mouse neurons, highlighting species-specific differences.\n- **Link:** [PMC Article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11094408/)\n\n### 2. Neuronal diversity and stereotypy at multiple scales through whole brain morphometry\n- **Published:** November 26, 2024\n- **Summary:** This paper discusses neuronal diversity and stereotypy across the whole brain using morphometric analysis, providing insights into structural variations at multiple scales.\n- **Link:** [PMC Article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11599929/)\n\n### 3.
