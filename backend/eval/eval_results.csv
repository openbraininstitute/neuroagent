test_case_1,How can I simulate on the platform ?,"On the Open Brain Platform, simulation capabilities are available for different types of models, including single neuron models, synaptome simulations, metabolism and NGV unit models, and more complex models like microcircuits and whole brain models (coming soon).\n\n### How to Simulate on the Platform\n\n1. **Choose a Model Type:**\n   - Single neuron models (morphological electric models - ME-models)\n   - Synaptome simulations\n   - Metabolism and NGV unit models (available as notebooks)\n   - Future models: microcircuits, brain regions, brain systems, whole brain\n\n2. **Select or Build a Model:**\n   - You can explore existing models on the platform.\n   - Customize models by changing cellular composition or other parameters.\n   - Create your own models if needed.\n\n3. **Run Simulations:**\n   - Currently, simulations are run via downloadable notebooks that you can execute remotely.\n   - Soon, the platform will support running notebooks and simulations directly on the platform.\n\n4. **Perform Analysis:**\n   - After running simulations, you can analyze the results using the platform's tools.\n\nIf you want, I can guide you to find specific models or notebooks for simulation or provide tutorials on how to run simulations on the platform. Would you like me to help you with that?",Correctness [GEval],0.521283,True,0.500000,"The actual output provides a general overview of simulation capabilities on the Open Brain Platform and outlines steps for simulating various model types.
