# Neuroagent

Neuroagent is an AI-powered conversational assistant for neuroscience research. Ask questions in natural language and get answers backed by real neuroscience data, simulations, and scientific literature.

## What Can Neuroagent Do?

Neuroagent helps you explore and analyze neuroscience knowledge through conversation:

- **Brain anatomy**: Find information about brain regions, hierarchies, and atlases
- **Cell biology**: Access morphologies, cell types, and electrophysiological recordings
- **Neural circuits**: Query circuit simulations, configurations, and analysis results
- **Scientific literature**: Search and read neuroscience papers
- **Data analysis**: Perform statistical analyses and generate visualizations
- **Computational work**: Run custom analyses when needed

## How It Works

Simply ask your questions naturally. Neuroagent understands the context of your conversation and:

1. **Interprets your question** - Understands what you're looking for, even with complex or multi-part queries
2. **Selects relevant capabilities** - Automatically determines which data sources and tools are needed
3. **Adapts to complexity** - Uses more sophisticated reasoning for difficult questions
4. **Provides grounded answers** - All information comes from verified neuroscience databases and literature

## Key Benefits

- **No query language needed**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Contextual understanding**: Neuroagent remembers your conversation and builds on previous questions
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Handles complex queries that require combining information from multiple sources
- **Transparent sources**: See what data sources were used for each answer
