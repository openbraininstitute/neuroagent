# Credits

Credits are used to track usage of the Neuroagent platform. Here’s how they work:

- **1 user message = 1 credit** — Each message you send counts as one credit.

- **Daily free allowance** — You receive **30 free credits per day**. These reset every day.

- **Above the free limit** — If you use more than 30 credits in a day, the extra usage is taken from the credits linked to your project. Make sure your project has enough credits if you expect heavy use.

In short: your first 30 messages each day are free; any further messages in that day use your project’s credits.
