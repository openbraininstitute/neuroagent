# What Neuroagent Can Access

Neuroagent connects you to a comprehensive collection of neuroscience data sources and analytical capabilities. You don't need to know which specific capability to use - just ask your question naturally, and Neuroagent will access the right information.

## Knowledge Sources

### Brain Structure & Anatomy
Access detailed information about brain organization:
- Brain regions and their hierarchical relationships
- Brain atlases from different species and studies
- Regional boundaries and anatomical definitions

### Cellular Data
Explore neurons and their properties:
- Cell morphologies (3D reconstructions)
- Cell type classifications (morphological and electrical types)
- Electrophysiological recordings
- Ion channels and their properties

### Models & Simulations
Work with computational neuroscience resources:
- Electrical models of neurons
- Morpho-electrical models
- Ion channel models
- Circuit configurations and simulation results
- Simulation campaigns and execution records

### Experimental Measurements
Query empirical data:
- Neuron density measurements
- Bouton density data
- Synapses per connection statistics
- Species, strains, and subject information

## Analytical Capabilities

### Circuit Analysis
Perform detailed circuit-level analyses:
- Extract connectivity metrics
- Analyze circuit populations
- Access morphological and electrophysiological metrics
- Generate simulation configurations

### Literature Access
Search and read scientific publications:
- Search papers by keywords and date ranges
- Access full paper content and metadata
- Get specialized knowledge about neuroscience resources

### Data Visualization
Generate visual representations:
- Plot cell morphologies in 3D
- Visualize electrophysiological traces
- Create custom visualizations for your data

### Custom Analysis
When standard capabilities aren't enough:
- Perform statistical analyses on datasets
- Run custom computational analyses
- Combine data from multiple sources

## How to Use These Capabilities

You don't need to memorize what's available. Simply ask questions like:

- "What cell types are found in the hippocampus?"
- "Show me pyramidal cell morphologies from layer 5"
- "What papers discuss GABAergic interneurons?"
- "Compare connectivity patterns between these regions"

Neuroagent will automatically determine which data sources and capabilities are needed to answer your question.
