# Model Routing

Neuroagent estimates how complex your question is and routes it to the appropriate model:

- **Simple questions** (e.g., "What is the hippocampus?") → Fast, straightforward answers
- **Moderate questions** (e.g., "Show me L5 pyramidal cells in the somatosensory cortex") → Standard processing with some reasoning
- **Complex questions** (e.g., "Compare morphological properties across cell types in different cortical layers") → Enhanced reasoning and multi-step analysis

This ensures Neuroagent uses the right level of computational power for your question—not too little, not too much.
