# How Neuroagent Chooses the Right Tools

Neuroagent has access to over 100 different capabilities for accessing neuroscience data and performing analyses. To answer your questions efficiently and accurately, it intelligently selects only the relevant capabilities for each conversation.

## Why This Matters

Rather than trying to consider all possible capabilities for every question, Neuroagent:

1. **Analyzes your conversation** - Reviews what you're asking about and what you've discussed before
2. **Identifies relevant capabilities** - Determines which data sources and tools are actually needed
3. **Focuses attention** - Concentrates on the most appropriate options for your specific question

This means you get faster, more accurate responses without needing to know what capabilities exist or how to access them.

## Intelligent Selection

When you ask a question, Neuroagent:

- **Looks at context**: Considers your entire conversation history, not just the latest question
- **Casts a wide net**: When uncertain, includes capabilities that might be useful rather than risk missing something important
- **Excludes the irrelevant**: Filters out capabilities that clearly don't apply to your question

For example, if you're asking about brain anatomy, Neuroagent won't consider tools for literature search or circuit simulation. If you're researching a specific topic, it will prioritize relevant knowledge sources.

## Adaptive Complexity

Neuroagent also estimates how complex your question is and adapts accordingly:

- **Simple questions** (e.g., "What is the hippocampus?") → Fast, straightforward answers
- **Moderate questions** (e.g., "Show me L5 pyramidal cells in the somatosensory cortex") → Standard processing with some reasoning
- **Complex questions** (e.g., "Compare morphological properties across cell types in different cortical layers") → Enhanced reasoning and multi-step analysis

This ensures Neuroagent uses the right level of computational power for your question - not too little, not too much.

## Benefits to You

- **Faster responses**: Less time spent considering irrelevant options
- **Better accuracy**: Focused attention on what actually matters for your question
- **Seamless experience**: All of this happens automatically - you just ask your questions naturally
